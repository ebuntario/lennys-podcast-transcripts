High-performing product teams can benefit from expanding core collaboration beyond product, engineering, and design. Etsy's "five-legged stool" includes insights (research/analytics) and marketing partners working as a tight leadership unit for each team. This model incorporates diverse viewpoints and constraints early, leading to better product decisions, though it requires clarity on final accountability, which typically rests with the product manager.
