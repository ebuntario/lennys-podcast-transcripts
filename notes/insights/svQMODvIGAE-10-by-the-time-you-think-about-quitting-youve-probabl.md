Multiple biases, like the [[concepts/sunk-cost-fallacy|sunk cost fallacy]] and endowment effect, work against the decision to quit. People generally won't quit until they feel they have no choice, often long after it was rational to do so. If you're thinking about quitting, it's likely past the optimal time, as you want certainty that is unattainable.
