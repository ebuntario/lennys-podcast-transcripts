Founder intuition is a form of data that isn't statistically significant yet. It's built from deep immersion with customers and the market. Product leaders should treat gut instincts as valid inputs, especially when exploring new spaces like Web3 where hard data is scarce. Balance intuition with rapid experimentation, but don't dismiss it merely because it lacks quantitative backing.
