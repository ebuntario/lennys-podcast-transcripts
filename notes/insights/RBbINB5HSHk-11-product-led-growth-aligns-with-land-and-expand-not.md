Product-led growth (PLG) is effective for low-risk land-and-expand motions, typically in the Main Street phase, but it cannot cross the chasm alone. Crossing the chasm requires solving high-risk problems for economic buyers, which demands a consultative, diagnostic sales approach. PLG companies eventually build sales teams to capture enterprise deals that require this different motion.
