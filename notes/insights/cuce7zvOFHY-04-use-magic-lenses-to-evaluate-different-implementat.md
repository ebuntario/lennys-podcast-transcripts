When choosing between potential project approaches, evaluate each option through different "magic lenses" such as customer experience, speed to market, growth potential, and financial viability. Plotting options on these axes creates a visual, multi-faceted comparison that makes trade-offs explicit. This [[concepts/decision-making|decision framework]] helps teams select a primary approach and identify a backup plan, reducing the fear of initial failure.
