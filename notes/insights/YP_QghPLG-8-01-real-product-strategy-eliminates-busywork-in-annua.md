A clear, aligned [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]] dramatically reduces the time and effort required for annual planning. When strategy is well-defined, planning shifts from a multi-week ritual of filling templates to a focused exercise that can be completed in days. This approach eliminates false precision in resource allocation and prevents teams from getting overwhelmed by scope creep.
