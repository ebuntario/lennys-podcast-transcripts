Journaling is a powerful practice for [[concepts/emotional-regulation|managing your mindset]] and reactions. Writing down swirling negative thoughts externalizes them, allowing you to examine their triggers and rationality objectively. This process acts like self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy, helping you identify what is within your control to change and letting go of irrational [[concepts/mindset-shifts|mental patterns]].
