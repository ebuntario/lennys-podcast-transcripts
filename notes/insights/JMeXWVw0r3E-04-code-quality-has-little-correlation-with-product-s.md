A common misconception among engineers is that high [[concepts/code-quality|code quality]] is essential for a successful product. Historical examples like YouTube, which had a reportedly messy codebase, show the two factors are largely unrelated. The focus should be on solving a real problem for users, not on perfect architecture, emphasizing [[concepts/outcome-over-process|outcome over process]].
