A strong [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]] is an integrated set of choices that outlines how you will win in your chosen marketplace. It answers critical questions like your winning aspiration, where you will play (specific markets and segments), and how you will win with your target audience. This clarity prevents teams from building for everyone and instead focuses effort on delivering exceptional value for a defined set of users.
