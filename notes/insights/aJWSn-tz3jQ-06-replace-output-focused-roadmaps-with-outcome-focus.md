Traditional roadmaps that commit to launching specific features by a date stifle learning and evidence-guided development. Instead, use outcome roadmaps that state the business or user result you want to achieve by a certain time (e.g., "reduce onboarding time to under two days by Q3"). This keeps the team focused on the goal and allows flexibility in how to achieve it through discovery and validation.
