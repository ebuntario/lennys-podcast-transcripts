Three attributes define a successful PM: **Raw Smarts** (problem identification/solving, learnability), **Drive/Grit** (curiosity, consumer-backward focus, resilience), and **[[concepts/persuasion|Influence]]** (the core function of the role). While raw smarts and drive can be developed, a prospective PM must be excited by, not scared of, the necessity of mastering [[concepts/persuasion|influence]] to succeed.
