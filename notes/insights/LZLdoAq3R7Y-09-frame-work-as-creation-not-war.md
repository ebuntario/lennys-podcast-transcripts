The language of war—"conquering markets," "destroying competition"—frames business as a destructive, depressing endeavor. Shifting to a [[concepts/organizational-culture|culture]] and vocabulary of creation, pride, and making something great changes how you think about your work. This fosters a spirit of addition and excitement rather than one of destruction and conflict.
