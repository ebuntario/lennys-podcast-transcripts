The line between [[concepts/product-operations|product operations]] and [[concepts/product-marketing|product marketing]] lies in their focus areas: product marketing positions products for external audiences and lead generation, while product ops educates internal teams on product value and usage. Product ops helps revenue teams understand how new features impact their roles and how to communicate value to customers, without crossing into sales enablement or campaign creation.
