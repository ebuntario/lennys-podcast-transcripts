No acquisition channel will succeed if the product fails to meet expectations, especially in B2B where switching costs are high. Early-stage companies should prioritize building an excellent product before scaling marketing efforts. When joining a startup, assess the team composition—a heavy investment in engineering and product relative to sales/marketing often signals a strong foundational product.
