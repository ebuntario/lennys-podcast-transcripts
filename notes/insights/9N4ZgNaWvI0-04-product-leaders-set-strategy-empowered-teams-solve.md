Empowerment does not mean teams choose what to work on, which leads to anarchy. Instead, [[concepts/product-leadership|product leaders]] define the product strategy and make the key bets on which problems to solve. Empowered teams are then given those problems and the autonomy to figure out the best solutions. This clarifies the distinct responsibilities of leadership (strategy) and teams (solution discovery and delivery).
