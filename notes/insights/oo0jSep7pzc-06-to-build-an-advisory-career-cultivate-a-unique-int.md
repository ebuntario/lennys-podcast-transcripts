To transition to an advisory or fractional role, you must become a top-tier expert in a specific, valuable intersection (e.g., bottoms-up SaaS activation). This requires choosing roles that build both depth in a domain and breadth across different types of product work or industries. Working at well-known, successful companies also provides credibility that makes this path more viable.
