Effective [[concepts/habit-formation|habit formation]] relies on designing powerful, immediate, and emotional reward loops, not just accountability. For example, publicly celebrate when a team member uses a new tool or takes care of their well-being, making them "feel like a million bucks." This positive reinforcement is more effective than enforcement and shapes team culture toward desired behaviors.
