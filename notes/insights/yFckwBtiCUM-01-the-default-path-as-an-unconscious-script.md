The [[concepts/default-path|default path]] is the unconscious story in your head about what you *should* do, often involving getting a job and working continuously through adulthood. When you operate on this path without conscious choice, you create implicit contracts with yourself about when and how you must work. The goal is not necessarily to leave this path, but to become aware of its trade-offs and consciously opt into your choices.
