To evaluate the people aspect of a company, observe team meetings or product reviews to understand dynamics and communication styles. Ask strategic questions like "Tell me about the last leadership disagreement and how it was resolved" during interviews. Candidates at any level should feel empowered to request these observations as part of their [[concepts/company-evaluation|due diligence]] process.
