Many startups mistakenly assume their early adopter cohort represents the broader market, leading to misaligned [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]] when scaling.

Companies should stress-test their product with experiments or features that gauge whether value propositions hold for a wider audience before investing heavily in expansion.
