The press release and FAQ are mechanisms to enforce [[concepts/working-backwards|working backwards]] thinking, but they aren’t the only way. You can adopt the spirit of problem-first thinking within any format your organization uses (slides, PRDs, etc.). Focus on building the muscle, not just the template, and adapt the mechanism to fit your company’s culture.
