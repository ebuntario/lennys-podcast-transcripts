When addressing technology challenges, start by understanding the core problem, then identify the people involved and their needs, before designing system solutions. This [[concepts/problem-people-system-framework]] prevents jumping directly to tool implementations without considering stakeholder requirements and organizational constraints. It ensures technology solutions actually solve business problems rather than creating new complexities.
