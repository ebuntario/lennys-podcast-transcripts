Use descriptive titles like "Lead" or "Head of [Domain]" instead of senior titles like Director or VP, especially in a startup's early years. This fosters a culture where people focus on [[concepts/scope-and-impact|scope and impact]] rather than title progression, reduces internal contention, and preserves flexibility to upgrade the role as the company scales without forcing painful demotions or departures.
