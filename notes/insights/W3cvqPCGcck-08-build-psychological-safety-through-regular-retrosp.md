High-performing teams consistently hold [[concepts/retrospective|retrospectives]], which are a key indicator of psychological safety. These sessions create a forum for teams to safely discuss what's working and what isn't, and more importantly, grant them the agency to change their processes. This cycle of reflection and action fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.
