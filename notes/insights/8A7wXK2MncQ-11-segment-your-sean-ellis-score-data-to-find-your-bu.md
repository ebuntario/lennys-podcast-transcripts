When a product's overall Sean Ellis Score is borderline, analyze the data by customer segment to find the "bullseye cohort" that shows extremely high disappointment scores. For example, Nubank found users with bills across multiple payment rails had a 70% "very disappointed" rate. Double down on serving this cohort's needs, as they reveal the product's core value and a path to broader appeal.
