A three-month sabbatical is a highly attainable and transformative investment, equivalent to just three months out of a potential 500-month working adulthood. It typically takes six to eight weeks just to unwind and disconnect from work identity, creating the mental space necessary for new insights to emerge. Framing this time as an "investment in your life MBA" can help justify it, as the clarity gained often leads to significant positive change.
