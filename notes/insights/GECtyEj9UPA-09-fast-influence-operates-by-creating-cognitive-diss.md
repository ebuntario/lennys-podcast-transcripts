The fastest mode of influence isn't about letting someone fail (slow) or teaching them new information to live with (moderate). It's creating cognitive dissonance in the moment by drilling down from a person's behavior to their underlying belief. Asking, "What do you believe that has you doing this?" exposes the logical disconnect and can lead to rapid change, especially in a habitat of trust where such challenges are permitted as a form of [[concepts/influence|influence]].
