In multi-sided [[concepts/marketplaces|marketplaces]] (e.g., consumers, drivers, restaurants), traditional [[concepts/okrs|OKRs]] often break down because objectives for one side inherently conflict with another (e.g., higher consumer fees hurt driver pay). Instead of divided OKRs, **Big Bets** framed as cohesive stories—where all levers are pulled in a coordinated narrative—provide better [[concepts/strategy-execution|alignment]] for these interconnected systems.
