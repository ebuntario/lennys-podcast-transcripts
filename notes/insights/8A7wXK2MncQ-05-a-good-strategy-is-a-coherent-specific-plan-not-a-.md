Strategy is not an ambitious goal or financial outcome; it's a coherent plan for applying your strengths against a core problem. As Kevin Systrom said, "We may not be right, but at least we are clear." A good [[concepts/strategy|strategy]] is specific: it defines a particular customer segment, their precise pain point, your unique solution, and your leveraged advantage. This clarity enables focus and a rapid read on whether your bets are working.
