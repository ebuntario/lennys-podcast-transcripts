Adopt the "10% planning time" rule: spend no more than 10% of your cycle (e.g., one week in a quarter) on planning, leaving the rest for [[concepts/strategy-execution|execution]]. This forces focus and prevents over-analysis. If you find yourself planning much more, your execution periods are likely too short or you are over-planning.
