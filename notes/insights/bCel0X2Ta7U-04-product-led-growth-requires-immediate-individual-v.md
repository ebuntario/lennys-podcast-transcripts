A product can be [[concepts/product-led-growth|product-led growth]] if an individual user can get value from it immediately without needing permission, integration keys, or a sales conversation. Tools that require buy-in from a department head or offer only long-term value are better suited for a sales-led motion, as they lack "day zero" value for a lone user.
