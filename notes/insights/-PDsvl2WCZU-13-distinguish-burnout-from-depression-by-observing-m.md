Burnout often manifests as exhaustion where you still perform work tasks but lack energy for hobbies; depression typically reduces motivation across all areas of life, including activities you normally enjoy. For example, with burnout you might skip an improv class due to fatigue, but with depression you might cancel it entirely and avoid socializing afterward. Recognizing these patterns helps in seeking appropriate support, whether through [[concepts/mental-health|therapy]], lifestyle adjustments, or professional resources.
