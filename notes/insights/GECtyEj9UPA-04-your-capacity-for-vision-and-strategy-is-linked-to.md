Your ability to engage with abstract, future-oriented vision work is heavily influenced by your level of openness.

High conscientiousness can compound this by making such discussions feel inefficient. Recognizing this allows you to be vulnerable, ask for translation, and partner with those high in openness to drive [[concepts/vision-work|vision work]] forward.
