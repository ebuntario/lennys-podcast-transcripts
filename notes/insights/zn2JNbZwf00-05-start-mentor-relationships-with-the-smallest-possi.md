When approaching a potential mentor, avoid asking for a call or coffee immediately. Instead, make a minimal request they can answer quickly, like a specific question via email. After they help, circle back to show how you applied their advice. This builds [[concepts/networking|trust]] and demonstrates you value their time, paving the way for a deeper [[concepts/coaching|mentorship]].
