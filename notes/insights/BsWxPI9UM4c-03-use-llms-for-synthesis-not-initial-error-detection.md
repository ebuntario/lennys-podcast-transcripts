Large language models are excellent for synthesizing open codes into axial codes (categories) after manual error analysis, but they should not replace the human in the initial detection stage. An LLM lacks the product context to identify subtle failures like a hallucinated feature or a poor user experience, which requires [[concepts/domain-expertise|domain expertise]].
