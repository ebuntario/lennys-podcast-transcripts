For a professional-grade [[concepts/ai-agents|AI coding agent]], the optimal [[concepts/user-onboarding|onboarding]] is different from starting with trivial tasks. Users should try it on a real, hard problem they currently face, such as a gnarly bug or a complex implementation. This approach, akin to building trust with a new teammate, allows the user to properly evaluate the agent's capability and naturally learn effective prompting strategies through collaboration on meaningful work.
