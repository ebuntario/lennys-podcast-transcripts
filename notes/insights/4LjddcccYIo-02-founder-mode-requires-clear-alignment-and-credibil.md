When working with a founder in "founder mode," start meetings by explicitly aligning on goals, success criteria, and desired outcomes. Build [[concepts/credibility|credibility]] by deeply understanding customer needs through direct interaction, which gives you a foundation to push back when necessary. This approach helps manage the intense pace and high expectations often set by visionary founders.
