Bring in marketing leadership after achieving clear product-market fit. Diagnose whether you need a product marketer (for launch excellence and positioning), a demand gen leader (for pipeline), or a brand/community builder. This ensures you're hiring for the specific bottleneck, not just following a generic playbook. Distinguish between Marketing (the function) and marketing (the whole-company discipline of telling your story).
