[[concepts/curiosity-loops]] provide structured [[concepts/advice-seeking]] by asking specific questions to 5-10 trusted contacts. This method surfaces contextual insights while respecting others' time. The process involves crafting focused questions, curating respondents, making requests lightweight, and closing the loop with gratitude.
