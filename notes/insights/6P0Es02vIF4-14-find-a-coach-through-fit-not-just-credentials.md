When looking for a coach, prioritize personal fit and style over credentials alone. A good coach will offer a free session to see if the partnership feels right. Coaches vary from structured, tactical guides to more exploratory partners; identify what you need. Use resources like the International Coaching Federation or referrals from leaders you admire to find potential matches.
