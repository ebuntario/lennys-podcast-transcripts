A strong recruiting strategy involves putting out a distinctive "bad signal" that intentionally turns some people off, thereby attracting those deeply aligned with the mission. For Palantir, this was a focus on defense and "saving the Shire," which filtered for people who found meaning in solving hard, messy problems over building social apps. This principle of [[concepts/purpose|mission alignment]] creates a powerful gravitational pull for specific, high-conviction talent.
