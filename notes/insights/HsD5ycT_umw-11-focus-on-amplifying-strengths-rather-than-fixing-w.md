Career advancement comes from leaning into and amplifying your unique strengths, not from obsessively fixing weaknesses. While mitigating critical liabilities is necessary, exceptional success is driven by doubling down on what you do exceptionally well. Shift performance conversations from "areas of improvement" to "how can we make your superpowers even more impactful?"
