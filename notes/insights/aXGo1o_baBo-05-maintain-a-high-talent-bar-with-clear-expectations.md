Define specific, measurable expectations for roles, moving beyond vague descriptors like "manages a team." Foster a culture where candid [[concepts/feedback-culture|feedback]] is normalized and seen as kind, not confrontational. When someone isn't meeting the bar, provide clear, direct communication about the gap and the required change, as avoiding this conversation ultimately harms both the individual and the team.
