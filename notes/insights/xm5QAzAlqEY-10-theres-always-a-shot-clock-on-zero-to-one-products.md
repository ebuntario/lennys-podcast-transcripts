When building a new product, operate with the awareness that there is always a "shot clock." The [[concepts/build-vs-buy|build-versus-buy]] decision is perpetually live, and if development takes too long, acquiring an existing solution often becomes the rational business choice. This instills a healthy urgency to ship and validate, preventing heartbreak when a slower, perfect internal project gets shelved for a faster external option.
