A common mistake in [[concepts/technical-leadership|engineering leadership]] is sheltering engineers from difficult problems to retain them, which ultimately stunts their growth. By treating engineers as accountable peers and giving them real responsibilities, they can advance into senior leadership roles. This shift allows engineers to develop by solving meaningful business challenges rather than being protected from them.
