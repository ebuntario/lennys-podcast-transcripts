Senior product leaders typically seek coaching during career milestones, such as becoming a CPO for the first time or moving from a large company to a startup. They realize that "what got me here won't get me there" and that the next level requires internal work. These individuals are often introspective and surrounded by mentors but need a partner for deeper, transformative growth.
