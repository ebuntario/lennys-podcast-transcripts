A common failure is allowing a "zombie product"—one with no clear path to success or right to win—to persist for years, draining resources. Often, the final forcing function to kill it comes when a customer finally wants to pay, revealing the long-term commitment it would entail. Have the courage to "call a spade a spade" early, speak truth to power, and reallocate those resources to more promising bets.
