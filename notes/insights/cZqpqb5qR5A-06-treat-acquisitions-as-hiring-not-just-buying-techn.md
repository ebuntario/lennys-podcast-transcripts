The hardest part of an [[concepts/acquisition-integration|acquisition integration]] is the people and culture shock, not the technology. Plan for a significant slowdown as the acquired team navigates new processes, decision-making structures, and long-term planning expectations. A better approach for accelerating a roadmap is often an "acqui-hire" model: buying a small team to rebuild their proven solution on your platform.
