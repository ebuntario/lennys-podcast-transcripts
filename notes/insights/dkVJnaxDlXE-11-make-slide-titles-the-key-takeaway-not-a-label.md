A simple but powerful improvement for any presentation is to make each slide's title the key takeaway, not just a topic label. Instead of "The Team," use "Our Team Brings 20 Years of Industry Experience." This requires zero cognitive work from the audience and makes the entire [[concepts/communication|communication]] flow more effectively.
