First-time founders frequently become "single-issue voters" based on their core skills, instinctively seeing their superpower as the solution to most problems. An engineer will default to engineering fixes, a designer to a redesign, and a business development expert to partnerships. To counter this [[concepts/cognitive-bias|cognitive bias]], you must consciously question your default assumptions and seek diverse perspectives from co-founders or advisors to ensure you're solving the real root cause.
