When hiring, prioritize [[concepts/first-principles-thinking|first principles thinking]] and critical thinking over specific domain expertise. Use a live problem-solving interview where candidates analyze a real company webpage or product, asking "why" repeatedly to understand their thought process. Look for candidates who ask insightful questions to build their own mental model, rather than applying a pre-existing framework without adaptation.
