Traditional on-the-job learning is inefficient due to slow feedback cycles. Use [[concepts/ai-for-learning|AI tools]] to create hyper-personalized, on-demand practice and feedback. For example, build a GPT that gives product scenario exercises or mimics your feedback style, allowing team members to get hundreds of reps in an afternoon instead of waiting weeks for real-world opportunities and reviews.
