A key principle for product teams is to "think big, ship small." Maintain a large, ambitious vision for the customer problem you're solving to avoid incrementalism. However, break that vision down into the smallest possible pieces to ship iteratively and learn quickly. This balances long-term [[concepts/product-strategy|strategy]] with the agility needed to adapt and validate assumptions in the market.
