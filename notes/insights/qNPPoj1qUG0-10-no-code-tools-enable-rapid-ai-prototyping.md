Tools like AutoML allow PMs and non-coders to train custom machine learning models with minimal effort by uploading labeled data. This enables rapid prototyping of AI applications, such as using drone photos to identify maintenance needs, dramatically reducing manual work. These [[concepts/no-code-tools|no-code tools]] democratize AI experimentation.
