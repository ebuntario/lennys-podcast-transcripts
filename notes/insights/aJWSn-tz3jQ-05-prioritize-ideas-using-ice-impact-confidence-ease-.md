The ICE framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease) provides a consistent, transparent way to evaluate ideas against clear goals. Breaking the evaluation into these three components fosters better discussion than simply arguing whose idea is better. Crucially, the [[concepts/confidence-meter|confidence score]] should reflect the quality of evidence supporting the impact and ease estimates, not just gut feeling.
