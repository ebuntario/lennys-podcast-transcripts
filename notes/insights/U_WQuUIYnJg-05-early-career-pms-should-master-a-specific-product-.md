Early in your career, aim to become world-class in one specific type of product ambiguity. This could be market ambiguity (creating something new), organizational ambiguity (managing complex teams and goals), domain expertise (e.g., ML or hardware), crafting (execution), or growth. Picking a lane and developing deep expertise gives you a strong foundation and a clear story to tell future employers about your specific value.
