Companies should implement attribution infrastructure that captures both first and last touch data from the beginning, even if they only use simple models initially. This involves storing UTM parameters, referrer URLs, and ad network identifiers as both user attributes and event properties. This [[concepts/future-proofing]] approach enables advanced attribution modeling later without requiring historical data reconstruction.
