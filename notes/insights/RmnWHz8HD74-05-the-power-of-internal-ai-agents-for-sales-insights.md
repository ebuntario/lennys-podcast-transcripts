Running AI agents on sales call transcripts (e.g., from Gong) can uncover the real reasons for lost deals, which often differ from the seller's perception. These agents can provide real-time deal coaching and identify systematic "bugs" in the [[concepts/go-to-market|go-to-market strategy]], such as poor objection handling or missing value demonstration. Teams can then run weekly sprints to fix these issues, treating them like product bugs.
