Instead of relying on inspirational but vague mission statements, build culture by logically deducing beliefs from your company's role. Start by asking, "Who is glad we exist and why?"—this defines your value creation. From there, deduce standards for quality, decision-making, and teaming. This creates a usable, logical habitat where actions are judged by their impact, moving from a "bias to action" to a "[[concepts/organizational-culture|bias to impact]]."
