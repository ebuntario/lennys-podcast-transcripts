A core principle of [[concepts/ai-engineering|AI-native engineering]] is "compounding engineering": for every unit of work, make the next unit easier. Instead of manually writing each Product Requirements Document (PRD), engineers can build a prompt that turns their rambling thoughts into a structured PRD. This investment in [[concepts/workflow-automation|workflow automation]] creates leverage, allowing the team to focus on higher-level [[concepts/product-development|product development]] rather than repetitive specification writing.
