Roughly 80% of product hypotheses fail. Therefore, avoid long, polished redesigns built in isolation. Instead, adopt fast, iterative testing with "embarrassing" early versions. This allows failure to act as a compass, guiding you toward the right solution quickly and cheaply. The goal is to validate or invalidate hypotheses rapidly before investing heavily in [[concepts/testing|full-scale implementation]].
