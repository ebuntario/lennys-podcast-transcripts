When you speak spontaneously under constraints, you often discover connections and ideas that weren't accessible through silent contemplation. This process of "thinking out loud" allows you to learn what you think as you say it, similar to how constraints fuel creativity. It demonstrates the power of your subconscious mind to generate coherent content when you trust it.
