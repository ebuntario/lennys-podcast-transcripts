Most products grow through [[concepts/growth-loops|growth loops]] rather than linear funnels, where users naturally bring in other users through built-in actions like sharing or publishing. Identifying your product's unique loop—whether it's a "black loop" of internal sharing or a "blue loop" of public publishing—is critical for scaling. Understanding this dynamic changes how you structure teams and prioritize features to maximize organic spread.
