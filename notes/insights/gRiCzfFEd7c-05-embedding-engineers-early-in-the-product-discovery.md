Involve engineers and tech leads in user research and discovery sessions, not just development. When engineers understand the "why" behind user needs, they can better assess technical feasibility and contribute to solution design. Treating engineers as [[concepts/cross-functional-partners|partners]] in discovery, rather than just resources for execution, increases team efficiency and alignment.
