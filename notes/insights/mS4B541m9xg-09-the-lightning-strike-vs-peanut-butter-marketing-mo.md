Instead of spreading your marketing budget evenly over time (the "peanut butter" approach), adopt a "lightning strike" model inspired by Hollywood movie launches. Concentrate disproportionate effort and resources to be undeniable to your target audience for a short, intense period. It's better to matter profoundly for one week a year than to be irrelevant all year. This approach, combined with a strong category point of view, is designed to generate powerful [[concepts/word-of-mouth|word-of-mouth]].
