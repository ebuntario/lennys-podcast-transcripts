B2B2C businesses must solve the complex problem of tying individual user data to company entities while maintaining separate acquisition and retention systems. Traditional B2C tools focus on user-event objects, while B2B CRMs like Salesforce track company relationships. The challenge lies in designing systems that map user journeys to company records without creating competing priorities between tools like HubSpot and Salesforce.
