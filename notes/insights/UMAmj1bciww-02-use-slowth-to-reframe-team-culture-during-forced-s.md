When external factors force a business to stop growing, rebranding teams (e.g., from "growth" to "slowth") can creatively maintain morale and focus. This reframing helps teams pivot their mission towards protecting and serving existing customers, turning a potential morale crisis into a unifying, purpose-driven effort.
