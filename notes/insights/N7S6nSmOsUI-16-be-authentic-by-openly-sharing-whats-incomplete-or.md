To build authenticity and trust with your team, be transparent about the state of work and your own thinking. For example, explicitly state, "This plan is 70% complete; the 30% I'm not confident about are X, Y, and Z." This [[concepts/authenticity|authenticity]] shows you're being real, invites collaboration on the uncertain parts, and prevents teams from mistaking optimism for a lack of awareness about challenges.
