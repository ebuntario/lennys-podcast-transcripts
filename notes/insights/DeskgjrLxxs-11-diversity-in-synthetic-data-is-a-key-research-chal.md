Ensuring [[concepts/synthetic-data|synthetic data]] covers a wide range of scenarios is crucial for models to generalize well beyond training examples. Researchers explore methods to inject diversity into generated tasks to improve model robustness. This is a fundamental problem in scaling synthetic training approaches for broad capability development.
