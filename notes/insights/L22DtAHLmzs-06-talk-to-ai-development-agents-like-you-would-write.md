The most effective way to interact with an AI coding agent is to treat it like a human developer colleague. Be specific about requirements that matter, but also allow for creative freedom where appropriate. This mirrors the skill of writing a good [[concepts/product-development|product spec]] or JIRA ticket—clear on outcomes, flexible on implementation—and leverages existing PM skills rather than requiring new "prompt engineering" tricks.
