Define core values based on existing behaviors rather than aspirations. Key cultural pillars include acting with urgency ("Deel speed"), maintaining default optimism to overcome challenges, and deeply caring about customer outcomes. In return, offer flexibility in how and where work gets done. This culture attracts talent who thrive in fast-paced, mission-driven environments.
