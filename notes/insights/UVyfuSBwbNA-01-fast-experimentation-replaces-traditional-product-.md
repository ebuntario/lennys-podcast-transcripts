For most product managers, [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]] is overrated. Your core strategy should be how fast you can move from hypothesis to data. If you can test ideas quickly through [[concepts/testing|experimentation]], your strategy becomes clear: do more of what works and stop what doesn't. This approach democratizes decision-making and moves it away from being dominated by the loudest voice in the room.
