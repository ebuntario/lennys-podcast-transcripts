A core shift on the pathless path is moving from tolerating work to actively designing your life around activities that make you feel alive. Pay close attention to what gives you energy versus what drains you after completing a task, such as writing, advising, or having conversations. The goal becomes protecting and pursuing the work you genuinely enjoy, rather than chasing external metrics of success within a traditional job-shaped container.
