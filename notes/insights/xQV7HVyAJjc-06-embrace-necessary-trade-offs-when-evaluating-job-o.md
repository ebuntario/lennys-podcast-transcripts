No job is perfect, and accepting a role requires conscious [[concepts/career-trade-offs|trade-offs]], such as choosing learning potential over higher salary. Being explicit about what you're giving up and why helps you commit to the choice without later resentment. This adult framing increases long-term satisfaction more than seeking a non-existent "perfect" role.
