While capital-intensive subsidies can bootstrap liquidity in a new market, the ultimate winner is determined by who delivers an incredible end-to-end [[concepts/product-led-growth|product experience]] first.

Therefore, keep product development and go-to-market efforts in lockstep, never letting marketing outpace the quality of the core experience.
