A significant majority of content, certifications, and community advice online describes [[concepts/feature-teams|feature team]] or project management practices, not the empowered product model used by top companies. This creates a self-propagating cycle where well-meaning advice reinforces suboptimal methods, making it critical for individuals to critically evaluate sources and seek out principles from consistently innovative companies.
