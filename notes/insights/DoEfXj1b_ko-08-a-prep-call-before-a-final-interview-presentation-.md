Incorporate a preparation call with the candidate before their final interview presentation. Review their draft, offer feedback, and provide additional context. This step gives you a realistic signal of what it will be like to work together—seeing how they receive and incorporate feedback. It also sets the candidate up for success and gives them a taste of the team's collaborative culture, creating a better mutual fit assessment.
