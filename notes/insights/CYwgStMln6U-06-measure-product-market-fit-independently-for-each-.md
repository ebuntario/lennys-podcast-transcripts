In a marketplace, you effectively have two [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fits]] to achieve—one for demand and one for supply. Measure them independently using traditional methods (e.g., the "how disappointed would you be" survey). A compelling value proposition on one side does not guarantee fit on the other, as issues like margin pressure can make the platform unattractive to suppliers.
