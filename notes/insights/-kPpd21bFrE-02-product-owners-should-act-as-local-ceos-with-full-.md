Revolut structures its teams so that product owners are [[concepts/local-ceo|local CEOs]] with end-to-end responsibility for their product area. They manage cross-functional teams including engineers and designers, define roadmaps, and are ultimately accountable for business results. This level of ownership builds skills that translate directly to founding companies or leading product divisions elsewhere.
