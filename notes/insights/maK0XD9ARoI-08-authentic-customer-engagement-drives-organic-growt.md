Having every team member, including founders and engineers, respond directly to customer support requests creates genuine connections that fuel word-of-mouth growth. This approach eliminates corporate barriers and allows companies to engage with their audience as real human beings. When customers feel heard by the actual people building the product, they become passionate advocates who tell their friends.
