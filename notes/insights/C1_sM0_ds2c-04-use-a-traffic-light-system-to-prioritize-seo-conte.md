A structured framework for SEO involves categorizing keywords by user intent and search volume. Label keywords as green (high intent, likely to convert), yellow (mixed intent), or red (informational only). Prioritize creating content for green keywords with the highest volume first, as this focuses effort on topics most likely to drive qualified leads and revenue.
