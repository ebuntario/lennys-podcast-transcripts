Effective [[concepts/habit-formation|habit formation]] in products like Duolingo uses a three-pillar [[concepts/gamification|gamification]] model: a tight core loop (daily lesson/reward), a metagame (long-term goals like leaderboards), and a user profile (reflecting investment). This structure provides immediate feedback, long-term motivation, and a sense of identity, creating a sustainable learning journey.
