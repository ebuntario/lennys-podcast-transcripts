You can significantly improve a model's output for a specific task by including examples of the problem and a good answer directly in your prompt. This technique acts as a lightweight form of [[concepts/fine-tuning|fine-tuning]], teaching the model the desired format and reasoning in context. While not as powerful as full fine-tuning, it's a highly accessible and effective method for most users.
