[[concepts/artificial-intelligence|AI]] will lead to a "collapse of the stack" within organizations, reducing the need for intermediaries like data analysts for simple queries. This empowers individuals to answer their own questions and get more done independently, mimicking the advantage of small, flat teams. The result could be a meritocracy where promotion is based on ingenuity and creativity rather than bureaucratic progression.
