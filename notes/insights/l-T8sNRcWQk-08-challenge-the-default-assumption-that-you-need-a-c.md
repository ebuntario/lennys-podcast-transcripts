Before hiring a coach, consider if alternatives like a [[concepts/curiosity-loop|curiosity loop]], a course, or building a support community might better achieve your goals. Coaching is most valuable for accelerated learning in hyper-growth situations or for sensitive, long-term personal development. Evaluate your specific needs rather than assuming a coach is the default solution.
