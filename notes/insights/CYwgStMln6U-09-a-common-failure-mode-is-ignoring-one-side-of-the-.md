Many marketplaces operate as one-sided businesses for too long, focusing only on demand-side funnels like ads and conversion. This is a mistake because [[concepts/network-effects|network effects]] are laggy; by the time you notice suppliers leaving due to a poor value proposition, it may be too late to save the business. Proactively invest in both sides to build a durable, two-sided flywheel.
