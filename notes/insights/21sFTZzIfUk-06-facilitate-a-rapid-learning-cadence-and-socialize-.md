The most important element of a growth process is facilitating a rapid learning cadence and providing means to socialize those learnings across the organization. Teams should document learnings from data exploration, experimentation, and user research in a shared document and hold regular impact and learnings reviews. The goal is to surface insights at the right time so they can be leveraged, as [[concepts/experimentation-culture|experimentation]] is about generating learnings the organization can use to deliver outcomes, not just delivering immediate results.
