Strong [[concepts/product-sense|product sense]] and conviction are built by developing an insatiable curiosity and constantly talking to users. These conversations create a mental library of anecdotes and insights that inform product decisions. Go into user research with a strong hypothesis (an "A- idea") so feedback can refine it to an A+, rather than starting from zero with no perspective.
