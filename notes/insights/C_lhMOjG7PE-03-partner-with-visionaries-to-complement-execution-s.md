If you excel at execution but not long-term vision, seek out and partner with "unreasonable" visionaries who see the future others don't. This complementary pairing allows you to focus on moving the ball forward 1% each week while they provide the strategic direction. Recognizing your own strengths and weaknesses enables you to build more effective [[concepts/leadership|leadership]] partnerships rather than trying to master everything yourself.
