Be brutally honest in job descriptions about the intensity and demands of the role. Phrases like "long hours, high pace," "difficult mission ahead," and "those seeking comfortable work need not apply" effectively filter out candidates who wouldn't thrive in a high-growth environment. This transparency attracts exactly the ambitious, mission-driven people needed for explosive scaling.
