In growth contexts where the cost of a false positive is low, consider using lower confidence intervals (e.g., below 95%) to run more experiments per year. To mitigate risk, harden your validation by pairing the quantitative data with strong [[concepts/qualitative-research|qualitative feedback]] that corroborates the hypothesis. This balanced approach can increase overall learning velocity and net positive impact.
