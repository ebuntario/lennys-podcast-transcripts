The product demo is one of the few elements you control in the sales process. On the first call, avoid showing the product entirely; instead, let the prospect visualize the solution in their head based on your problem discussion. For [[concepts/b2b-sales|enterprise sales]], this slows the process down appropriately and ensures the right stakeholders are involved before the reveal.
