A company's enduring culture is heavily influenced by its first 10-15 hires. Look for people genuinely excited about the mission, not just viewing it as a career step. Conducting "culture interviews" to assess alignment with core values and seeking diverse backgrounds (like former founders) can create a tight-knit, driven team that feels more like a group of friends on a project than coworkers.
