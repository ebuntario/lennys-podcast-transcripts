Lasting change often follows a four-step process: begin with suffering, seek the truth behind the suffering, practice [[concepts/self-compassion|self-compassion]] upon discovering the root cause, and finally extend compassion to others. This framework rewires one's foundational identity, upon which all external life choices are built, leading to authentic transformation.
