Teams building a product must also understand how to communicate its value to the market, as a great product without a distribution plan is ineffective. Merging [[concepts/product-management|inbound development]] with [[concepts/product-marketing|outbound marketing]] ensures cohesive strategy and execution, preventing scenarios where features launch but users remain unaware.
