Immerse yourself in user conversations by talking to both users and non-users, and by joining sales calls. Establish a recurring cadence with the sales team to share roadmap plans and hear customer pain points. Operationalize insights by creating shareable artifacts (like Loom videos) for sales to use and by logging all feedback into a backlog (e.g., via Asana) for weekly grooming and [[concepts/product-roadmap|roadmap]] prioritization.
