In B2B, where sample sizes are small, design [[concepts/growth-experimentation|experiments]] to fail conclusively by maximizing the treatment effect. Throw all plausible tactics and resources at a hypothesis in one test. If it fails with maximum effort, you can decisively abandon the idea. This prevents repeatedly testing the same intuition and creates a culture where failure is celebrated as learning, not just a lack of results.
