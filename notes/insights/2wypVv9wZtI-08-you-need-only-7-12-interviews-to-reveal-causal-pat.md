For [[concepts/jobs-to-be-done|Jobs-to-be-Done]] research, causal patterns and sets of pushes/pulls/anxieties begin to repeat after 7-8 [[concepts/customer-interviews|interviews]]. Conducting 10-12 interviews is typically sufficient, and it's more effective to do two rounds of 12 interviews than one round of 24. Use strategic sampling based on known market ranges (e.g., age, experience) rather than aiming for random statistical significance.
