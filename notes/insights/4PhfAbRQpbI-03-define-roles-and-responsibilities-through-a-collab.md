A powerful exercise for team alignment is having each role (e.g., PM, engineering manager, designer, data scientist) write down their own responsibilities *and* their expectations of their counterparts. By reviewing these documents together, the team arrives at a shared contract. This clarifies [[concepts/role-clarity|role clarity]], prevents overlap, and establishes clear accountability, especially for shared responsibilities like execution velocity.
