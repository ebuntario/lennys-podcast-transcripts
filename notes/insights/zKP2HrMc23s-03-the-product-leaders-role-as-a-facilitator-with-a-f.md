When joining a company with a strong product-minded founder, an initial key role for a product leader is to act as a facilitator, not a primary decision-maker. The goal is to build systems that ensure alignment between the founder's vision and the executing teams, helping everyone model the founder's thinking and maintain context as the company scales.
