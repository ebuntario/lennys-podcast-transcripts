Instead of relying on unreliable AI guardrails, the most practical defense is applying strict [[concepts/permissioning|permissioning]] principles from classical cybersecurity. This involves architecting systems so that an AI agent only has the minimum permissions necessary for its specific task (e.g., read-only for summarization, no send-email capability).
