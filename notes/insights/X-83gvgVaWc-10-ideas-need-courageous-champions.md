Great, [[concepts/radical-ideas|radical ideas]] often need someone to fight for them, even at personal risk. The story of John Houbolt championing Lunar Orbit Rendezvous for the Apollo program shows that advocacy is for the idea itself, not self-promotion. Have the courage of your convictions to be a voice for ideas you believe in, understanding that it may take time and persistence for them to be adopted.
