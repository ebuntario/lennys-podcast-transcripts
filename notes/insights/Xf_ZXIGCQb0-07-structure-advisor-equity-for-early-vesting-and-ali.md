When engaging a [[concepts/growth-advisors|growth advisor]], structure equity compensation to align incentives and de-risk the relationship for both parties. Prefer equity over cash to ensure you're "in it together," and implement a three-month cliff so either side can walk away if value isn't being delivered. Front-load vesting to incentivize the advisor to share knowledge and create impact quickly, rather than holding back.
