Not everyone needs or wants to become a full-stack builder; deep specialization will continue to have a place, particularly for building systems that empower others. However, the ratio of specialists to generalists will shift dramatically. Organizations will require fewer people in highly specialized roles as AI and full-stack builders handle more of the end-to-end workflow.
