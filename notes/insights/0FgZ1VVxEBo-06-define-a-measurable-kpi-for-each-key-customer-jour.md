For each major milestone in the customer journey, establish a clear [[concepts/key-performance-indicators|KPI]] that indicates whether the customer received the intended value. For example, a "first value" KPI might be a combination of specific feature uses. These metrics enable proactive nurturing and reactive win-back campaigns when customers disengage.
