When customer success or product teams are given pure revenue targets (like "extract more money from the base"), it can damage customer relationships and long-term trust. The core goal should be customer happiness and delivering value. While alignment with revenue is good, weaponizing these functions can lead to short-term gains that anti-compound and harm the business over time.
