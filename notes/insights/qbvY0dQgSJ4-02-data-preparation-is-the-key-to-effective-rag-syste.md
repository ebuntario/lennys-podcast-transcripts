The biggest performance gains in [[concepts/rag-systems|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)]] solutions come from thoughtful [[concepts/data-preparation|data preparation]], not from agonizing over which vector database to use. This includes designing optimal chunk sizes, adding contextual metadata like summaries, and reformatting data into question-answer pairs to make it more retrievable for AI.
