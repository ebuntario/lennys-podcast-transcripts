Instead of directly asking for weaknesses, ask reference providers to contrast the candidate with different personas (e.g., "Who identifies the right problems vs. who executes flawlessly?"). This technique gives them an "out" to describe the candidate's true strengths and gaps without feeling like they're delivering negative judgment. It surfaces more honest, nuanced feedback.
