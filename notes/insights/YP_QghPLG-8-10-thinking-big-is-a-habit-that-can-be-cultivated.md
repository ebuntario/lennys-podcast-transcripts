[[concepts/strategic-thinking|Thinking big]] is not an innate trait but a habit developed in environments that encourage it. At Google, for example, teams routinely asked, "Can we make this a $100 million opportunity?" rather than settling for smaller wins. This mindset pushes teams to expand the potential of their projects and pursue transformative opportunities, though it requires being willing to let go of smaller, sure bets.
