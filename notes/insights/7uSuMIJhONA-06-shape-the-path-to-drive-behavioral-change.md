When introducing new rituals or processes, use the "rider, elephant, path" model from *Switch*: direct the rider (explain the logic), motivate the elephant (appeal to emotions), and shape the path (make the desired behavior easy). Templatizing rituals and giving them memorable names helps [[concepts/change-management|change]] stick by reducing friction and creating identity.
