Traditional planning (forecasting) starts from the present and projects forward, which inherently limits you by the constraints of the past. Instead, use [[concepts/strategic-thinking|backcasting]]: envision a successful future 5+ years out, make it true in your mind, and then work backward to determine what had to happen to create that reality. This method "rejects the premise" of the current status quo and unlocks unconstrained thinking for radical innovation.
