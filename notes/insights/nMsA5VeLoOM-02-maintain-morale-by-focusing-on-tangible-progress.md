The only reliable way to maintain team morale during difficult periods is to make visible progress. Extrinsic motivators or speeches are less effective than people seeing real product developments and customer adoption. This principle applies to navigating market downturns, as seen in Web3 and during Airbnb's revenue crisis, where focusing on building and customers kept teams motivated.
