Startups typically cannot compete with incumbents on price, as larger companies can leverage scale or offer loss leaders. A [[concepts/pricing-strategy|price-based differentiation]] is often not durable. The exception is when AI enables a fundamentally new, cheaper solution to a previously expensive problem, but even then, the price advantage often needs to be substantial (e.g., 10x cheaper) to overcome potential quality trade-offs.
