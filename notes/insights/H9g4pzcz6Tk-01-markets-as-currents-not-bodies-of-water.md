The most interesting markets are not static bodies of water but dynamic [[concepts/market-dynamics|currents]] with inherent momentum. Founders should seek markets where underlying changes create a current that can pull their company forward, making it easier to build something enduring. This focus on momentum is more important than initial market size when evaluating an opportunity.
