A key signal for whether to continue a struggling startup is whether founders still enjoy the work, their co-founders, and their customers. If the work feels like a drag and relationships are suffering, it may be time to stop. However, if founders genuinely love their product and customers despite challenges, that passion can fuel the persistence needed to turn things around.
