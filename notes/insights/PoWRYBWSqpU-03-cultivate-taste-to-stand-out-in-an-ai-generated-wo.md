As AI reduces the cost of information production, the resulting "cacophony of slop" makes [[concepts/taste|taste]] a critical differentiator. Your taste is defined by having a distinctive, compelling perspective that differs from what an LLM would generate. Leaning into your unique [[concepts/taste|taste]] and perspective is more valuable than generic execution in the AI era.
