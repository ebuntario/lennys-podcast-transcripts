A successful [[concepts/freemium-model|freemium model]] requires two distinct, great products. The free version must be so good that it generates organic [[concepts/word-of-mouth|word-of-mouth]] growth on its own. The premium version must be sufficiently better and differentiated to drive upgrades. Weakening the free product to protect premium conversions often kills the word-of-mouth engine needed for the model to work.
