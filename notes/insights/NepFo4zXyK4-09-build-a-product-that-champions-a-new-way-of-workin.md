For a product to inspire passionate advocacy, it should equip users with a philosophy for a new way of working, not just be a better tool. Controversial or revolutionary aspects (like real-time multiplayer editing) create narrative tension that signals change. When users champion your product, they are also championing a [[concepts/category-creation|new paradigm]], which creates deeper loyalty and organic growth.
