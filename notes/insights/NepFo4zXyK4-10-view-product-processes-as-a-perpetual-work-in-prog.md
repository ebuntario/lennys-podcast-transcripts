There is no perfect, static way to run product development. Teams should embrace that their processes—like goal-setting, planning, and reviews—are always a "work in progress." This mindset encourages [[concepts/testing|experimentation]] and adaptation, allowing teams to continuously learn and improve their ways of working rather than sticking rigidly to a potentially outdated framework.
