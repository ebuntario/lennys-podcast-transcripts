Instead of using a single, general model for everything, effective AI products will break problems down and use specialized, [[concepts/fine-tuning|fine-tuned models]] for specific tasks. This approach mirrors how a company operates as an ensemble of humans with different expertise. Using models of different sizes and capabilities for different parts of a workflow leads to better, more cost-effective outcomes.
