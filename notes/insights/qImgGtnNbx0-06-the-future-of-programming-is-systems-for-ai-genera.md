The next evolution in software development will be programming systems designed for AI, not human ergonomics. When the marginal cost of generating code approaches zero, the priority shifts to verification, safety, and ease of modification. Future systems will leverage techniques like formal verification, compile-time checks (like Rust's memory safety), and AI supervision to allow builders to create complex, reliable software rapidly without manually reviewing every line.
