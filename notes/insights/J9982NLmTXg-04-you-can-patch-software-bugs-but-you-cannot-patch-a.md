A critical difference between classical cybersecurity and AI security is that software bugs can be definitively patched, while vulnerabilities in a trained model's reasoning are persistent. You can be 99.99% sure a software bug is fixed, but with an AI system, you can be 99.99% sure the [[concepts/adversarial-robustness|adversarial]] problem still exists.
