News organizations can train algorithms on editorial importance scores rather than just engagement metrics, creating fundamentally different content distribution systems. This approach scales expert judgment while still optimizing for business outcomes like reach and conversion. The key difference from platform algorithms is the ability to assess content quality directly rather than inferring it from user behavior signals.
