A powerful metric for companies with a [[concepts/product-led-growth|PLG]] foundation is **product-driven revenue**, which accounts for all revenue from customers where there was meaningful value-based activity in the product before any sales contact. This metric tells the story of your PLG efficiency across both self-serve and sales-led channels. Interestingly, the product-driven cohort often contributes a relatively greater amount to net retention, highlighting the importance of understanding the macro-level contribution of the freemium motion when optimizing packaging and pricing.
