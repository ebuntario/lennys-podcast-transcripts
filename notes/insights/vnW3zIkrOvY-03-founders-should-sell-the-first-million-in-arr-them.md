Founders should personally close early deals to deeply understand the sales process and customer commitment before hiring a sales team. This hands-on experience provides invaluable insights for scaling and gives confidence to the first sales hires. If the core team can't sell the product, hiring someone externally to solve that problem is often wishful thinking.
