When joining a new team, leaders often make the mistake of "coming in swinging" with changes before establishing trust. The core theme of negative feedback is often that you haven't earned the team's trust, not that your ideas are wrong. To build trust, you must first listen to understand individual motivations and shared goals, rather than inflicting change upon people. This approach transforms resistance into collaboration and dramatically improves team engagement.
