A true source of [[concepts/competitive-advantage|competitive advantage]] (or "power") must provide a tangible benefit, like a cost or price advantage, *and* a durable barrier that prevents competitors from replicating it. A moat alone, without a valuable "castle" inside, does not constitute power. This combination is essential for creating sustainable, superior returns.
