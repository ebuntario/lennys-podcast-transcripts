In its best form, product ops is a small, high-leverage team that centralizes expertise in user research and data analytics to enable product teams. However, a major red flag is when product ops is defined around "process and governance." This often indicates it's being used as a tool for control or to compensate for poor [[concepts/product-leadership|product leadership]], rather than for enablement.
