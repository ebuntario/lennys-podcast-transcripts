For entrepreneurs struggling with anxiety or focus, properly prescribed medication like SSRIs or ADHD treatment can be transformative, providing mental clarity and reducing unproductive rumination. Viewing these medications as tools for brain health, similar to taking Tylenol for a headache, removes unnecessary stigma. Getting an accurate diagnosis and exploring treatment options can significantly improve both professional effectiveness and personal relationships.
