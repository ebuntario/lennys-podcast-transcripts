Measure productivity by whether you did what you planned for the intended duration without distraction, not by checking off tasks. This metric creates an accurate [[concepts/feedback-loop|feedback loop]] for how long work actually takes, combating the planning fallacy. Ironically, this approach leads to finishing more because you understand your true capacity.
