The best time to learn how to be a leader is before you have the title, when mistakes are less costly and you can receive constructive feedback. Companies should promote people to do the job they have already been practicing, not to learn the job. This prevents promoting individuals into incompetence and the resulting dysfunctional cycles of poor management.
