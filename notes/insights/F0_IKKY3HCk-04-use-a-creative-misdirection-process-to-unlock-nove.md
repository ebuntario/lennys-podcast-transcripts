Large brainstorming sessions are ineffective for naming; instead, use small teams with different briefs. Have one team work on the real project, another believe they're working for a disguised competitor, and a third work on a completely different product category. This [[concepts/creative-misdirection|creative misdirection]] frees people to make mistakes and explore freely, often yielding the most innovative names from the teams not focused on the "real" assignment.
