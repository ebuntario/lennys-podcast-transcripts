One of the most effective ways to improve as a speaker is to record yourself practicing and then review the playback. While uncomfortable, this process allows you to hear your pacing, tone, and phrasing objectively. Aim to know your material so well you can deliver it flawlessly in casual settings, which builds immense confidence for the actual stage.
