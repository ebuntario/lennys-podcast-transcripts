When a product becomes too complex and lacks [[concepts/operational-flexibility|operational flexibility]], the hardest but necessary decision may be to rebuild it from scratch. This often happens when teams get seduced by algorithmic sophistication but neglect how operators need to interact with the system. Recognizing this requires emotional maturity to admit the current approach isn't working and to commit to a simpler, more controllable solution.
