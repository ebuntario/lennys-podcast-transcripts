Simple, memorable [[concepts/success-metrics|metrics]] like "10 friends in 14 days" are powerful for creating organizational momentum. The exact number matters less than having a concrete, communicable goal that teams can rally around. This approach cuts through academic debate and focuses energy on directional improvement, even if the metric isn't perfectly correlated with long-term outcomes.
