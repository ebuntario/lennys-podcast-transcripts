The most effective teams combine high energy, sound judgment, low ego, and small team sizes. This combination, observed at Stripe, enables rapid decision-making, deep collaboration, and exceptional outcomes. Leaders should actively foster these traits by modeling low-ego behavior, empowering small teams, and hiring for judgment alongside skill.
