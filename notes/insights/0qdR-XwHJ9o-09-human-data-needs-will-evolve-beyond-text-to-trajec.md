Future training data will include more trajectories (screen recordings with voice-over of problem-solving), multimodal data (audio, video), and tool-use sequences. As models advance, labs will seek data on how humans interact with software, scientific instruments, and real-world workflows, moving beyond purely academic text to improve [[concepts/future-of-ai|practical reasoning and automation]].
