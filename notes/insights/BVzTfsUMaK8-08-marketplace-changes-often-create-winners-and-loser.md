Managing a marketplace is like a game of whack-a-mole; improving the experience for one group (e.g., new suppliers) can degrade it for another (e.g., existing demand). Significant platform changes often reallocate attention or inventory, creating winners and losers. Leadership must consciously decide if the created winners are more valuable to the long-term [[concepts/platform-governance|platform health]] than the losers.
