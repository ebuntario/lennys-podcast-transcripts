A well-shaped idea can be described in fewer than ten key components and leaves engineers saying, "I know exactly what to build." It uses techniques like breadboarding and fat-marker sketches to communicate flows and logic, not just high-fidelity [[concepts/ui-design|UI mockups]] that hide technical complexities. The measure of success is shared understanding, not the volume of documentation.
