Block transitioned from a GM structure (independent business units) to a functional structure (all engineers reporting to one head). This change, aligning with [[concepts/conways-law|Conway's Law]], was key to driving a unified [[concepts/technical-strategy|technical strategy]] and becoming AI-native. It allows for shared tools, platforms, and policies, enabling deeper technical focus and company-wide initiatives like AI adoption.
