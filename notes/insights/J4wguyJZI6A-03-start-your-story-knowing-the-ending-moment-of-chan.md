Effective storytelling begins by identifying the ending—the five-second moment of change—and then determining the beginning, which should operate in opposition to it. This creates a clear narrative arc, such as moving from "no confidence" to "confidence" or "no belief" to "belief." Knowing the end guarantees you have something important to say, rather than just reporting events chronologically.
