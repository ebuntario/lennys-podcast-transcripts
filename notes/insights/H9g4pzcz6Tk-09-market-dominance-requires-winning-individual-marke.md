The full value of a marketplace model is realized only with dominant market share. To scale, you must first have a repeatable playbook for winning a single, constrained market. Expansion should then focus on "putting more wood behind fewer arrows"—decisively winning one new market at a time—rather than planting many flags without achieving dominance in any.
