Product managers should treat their own workflows and team [[concepts/product-processes|processes]] as something to be iterated upon. If a prescribed methodology (like a specific Agile framework) doesn't help you be a better product manager or deliver value, you have the agency to adapt or change it. The goal is effectiveness, not adherence to dogma.
