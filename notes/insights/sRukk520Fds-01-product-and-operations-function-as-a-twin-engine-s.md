A business with a heavy operational component operates most efficiently when product and operations work in harmony, like a twin-turbine jet. While you can fly on one engine temporarily, true effectiveness comes from both engines working together, leveraging operations for fast iteration and deep qualitative insights and product for scalable technology solutions. This [[concepts/product-operations-synergy]] creates a powerful feedback loop for building better products.
