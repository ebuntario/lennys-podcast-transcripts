A practical method for [[concepts/first-principles|first-principles thinking]] is the problem-cause-solution model. Instead of trying to solve a broad problem directly (e.g., "growth"), first identify and rank all underlying causes by magnitude (e.g., market willingness to pay, accuracy challenges). Then, design solutions that target the highest-impact causes, creating a clear line of sight from action to problem mitigation.
