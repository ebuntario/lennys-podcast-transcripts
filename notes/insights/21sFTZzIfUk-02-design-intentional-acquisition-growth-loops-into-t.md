Founders should have strong hypotheses about where new users will come from and be intentional about designing early [[concepts/growth-loops|acquisition growth loops]] into the product experience. For example, Snyk built a powerful content loop where it scans connected GitHub repos, finds vulnerabilities, and creates branded pull requests to fix them; other developers see these PRs, follow links to Snyk, and create accounts, continuing the loop. Dedicating time to design these loops into the product from the beginning creates a significant advantage when the product clicks with the market.
