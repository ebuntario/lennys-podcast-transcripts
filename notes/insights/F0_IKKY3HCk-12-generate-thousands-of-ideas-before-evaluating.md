A list of 200 names is insufficient—aim for 1,000-1,500 ideas, directions, and fragments before beginning evaluation. During the generation phase, suspend judgment and focus on quantity and variety. Only after creating this large pool should you begin speculating about potential and possibilities, not evaluating based on immediate reactions.
