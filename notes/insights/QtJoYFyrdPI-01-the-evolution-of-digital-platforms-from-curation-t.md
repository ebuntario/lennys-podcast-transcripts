The internet began with user [[concepts/curation|curation]], where platforms digitized goods like music and books and asked users to organize them. This shifted to algorithmic [[concepts/recommendation|recommendation]], requiring a complete rethink of user experience and business models. We are now entering the [[concepts/ai-generation|generation]] era, where AI creates content, a shift that will again force fundamental product redesigns.
