Attempts to over-control supply in a [[concepts/managed-marketplaces|managed marketplace]] can backfire because human behavior is often non-deterministic. Instead of heavy-handed control, set clear quality guardrails and provide coaching and tools to help supply succeed. Invest in hands-on tactics only to close specific gaps, as this respects [[concepts/user-empowerment|market forces]] and avoids unpredictable negative reactions from your supply base.
