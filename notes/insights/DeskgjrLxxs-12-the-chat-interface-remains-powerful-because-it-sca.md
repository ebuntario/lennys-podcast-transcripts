Chat provides a flexible [[concepts/user-interface|interface]] that works whether interacting with a basic model or a superintelligent one, similar to talking to different humans. Its conversational nature feels natural and socially familiar, lowering adoption barriers. While new form factors will emerge, chat's simplicity and adaptability make it a durable interaction paradigm.
