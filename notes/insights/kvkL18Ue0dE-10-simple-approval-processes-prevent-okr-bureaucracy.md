Instead of hierarchical approval chains, have teams share OKRs with three peer groups for quick feedback within 24 hours. This maintains alignment while avoiding bureaucratic delays that kill momentum. The philosophy recognizes that imperfect OKRs executed quickly create more learning than perfect ones debated endlessly—embracing [[concepts/decision-velocity|decision velocity]] over perfection.
