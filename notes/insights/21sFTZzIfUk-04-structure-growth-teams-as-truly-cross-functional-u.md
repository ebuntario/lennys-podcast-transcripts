Effective [[concepts/growth-team|growth teams]] should be truly cross-functional, with engineers, a product manager, a designer, a growth marketer, and decision science support all aligned around common objectives and KPIs. This structure resolves inherent tensions and misaligned incentives that often occur between separate R&D and marketing functions. Including a growth marketer within the product team, in particular, enables a broader palette of ideas and a bigger toolbox for execution, allowing for faster testing and learning.
