When delivering [[concepts/constructive-feedback|constructive feedback]], focus on observable facts rather than judgments. For example, say "What I've observed is that the documents lack a clear conclusion" instead of "Your writing is bad." This neutral approach makes the feedback easier to give and receive. Then, connect the feedback to shared goals, such as career advancement or team success, to frame it as a collaborative effort for improvement.
