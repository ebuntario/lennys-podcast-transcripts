In team discussions, it's critical to identify whether someone is disagreeing with an idea or simply misunderstanding it. Push to clarify: if it's a misunderstanding, spend time ensuring both parties can articulate the other's point of view. If it's a [[concepts/decision-making|disagreement]], stop wasting time on circular arguments and address the core conflict directly.
