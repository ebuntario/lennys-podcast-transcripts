Charging for a POC acts as a lead qualification mechanism, filtering out tire-kickers. However, frame the POC fee as payment for building the business case, not as an anchor for the final commercial price. If pressed for budget, contextualize price based on value (e.g., "we unlock $10M in value") or provide a range, keeping the conversation focused on [[concepts/value-contextualization|value]].
