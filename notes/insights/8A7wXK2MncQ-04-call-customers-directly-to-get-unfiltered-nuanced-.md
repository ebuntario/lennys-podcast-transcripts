Instead of relying solely on aggregated survey data or mediated research reports, product builders should pick up the phone and call users directly. By the fifth call, you can often predict the core feedback patterns. This direct connection provides tone, nuance, and emotional insight that statistics miss, leading to faster, more accurate product iterations.
