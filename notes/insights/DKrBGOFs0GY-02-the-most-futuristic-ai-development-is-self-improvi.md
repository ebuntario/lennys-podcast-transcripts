The team building an AI coding tool uses that same tool to build itself, creating a [[concepts/self-improving-systems|self-improving loop]]. This approach breaks down language barriers, allowing engineers to contribute to projects in unfamiliar languages by collaborating with the AI. It enables choosing the right language for the job without being constrained by team expertise, fundamentally changing contribution dynamics.
