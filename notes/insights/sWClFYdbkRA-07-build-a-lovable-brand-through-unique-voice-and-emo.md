A distinctive brand voice that's quirky, humorous, and doesn't take itself too seriously creates emotional connections that drive word-of-mouth. This requires consistency across all touchpoints—from push notifications to emails—and willingness to take risks that might feel unorthodox. When users feel something (amusement, surprise), they're more likely to remember and share the experience.
