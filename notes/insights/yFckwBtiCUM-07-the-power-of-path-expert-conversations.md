To explore an unconventional path, reach out to someone a few years ahead of you on a similar journey for a "path expert" conversation. Craft a thoughtful message explaining your curiosity and ask if you can send a list of written questions if a call isn't possible. Most people are willing to share their experiences, and these conversations provide invaluable maps, normalize the path, and reduce the feeling of being alone.
