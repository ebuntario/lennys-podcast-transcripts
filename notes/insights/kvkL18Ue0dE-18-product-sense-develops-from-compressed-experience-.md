Product intuition comes from pattern recognition developed through diverse experiences, not magical talent. Aspiring product managers should focus on accumulating varied experiences (engineering, design, business roles) rather than worrying about lacking "natural" product sense. This [[concepts/skill-development|skill development]] perspective is liberating—expertise emerges from deliberate practice and exposure to different business contexts.
