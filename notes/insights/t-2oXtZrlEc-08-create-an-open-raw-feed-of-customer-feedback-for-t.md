Pipe all customer feedback—from support, sales, NPS, and social media—into an open Slack channel and database with no gatekeepers. This raw feed empowers engineers and designers to consume direct customer context and even reach out to ask clarifying questions. Building this [[concepts/user-centric-design|customer-centric]] muscle requires balancing reaction with focus but dramatically improves product sense across the team.
