The human brain prefers information that's easy to process, a principle known as [[concepts/processing-fluency|processing fluency]]. Names that are simple, familiar in their components, and easy to pronounce are more likely to be accepted and remembered. Avoid overly complex or difficult names, as cognitive friction causes people to mentally walk past them rather than lean in.
