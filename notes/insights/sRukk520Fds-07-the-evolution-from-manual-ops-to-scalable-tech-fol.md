Operational processes naturally evolve from manual, high-touch methods to scalable, technology-driven solutions as volume increases. For example, driver onboarding progressed from one-on-one sessions to classroom settings, then to videos, and finally to automated credential validation. The [[concepts/automation-tipping-point]] is reached when operational improvements can no longer viably handle the scale, freeing up ops teams to tackle the next business challenge.
