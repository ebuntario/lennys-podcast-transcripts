An [[concepts/minimum-viable-product|MVP]] is not about building something low-quality or cheap.

The "minimum" is fluid and context-specific, defined by what is necessary to test your [[concepts/leap-of-faith-assumptions|leap of faith assumptions]] while containing the liability of a potential mistake.
