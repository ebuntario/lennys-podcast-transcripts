Palantir only promoted people to product manager roles after they had proven themselves as forward deployed engineers. This ensured PMs had deep [[concepts/empathy|customer empathy]], a bias for action, and an understanding of how customers actually work. It avoided the failure mode of "Google Docs syndrome," where PMs are detached from real-world implementation and outcomes.
