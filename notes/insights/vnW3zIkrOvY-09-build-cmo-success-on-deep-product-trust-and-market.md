A CMO's success, especially in technical domains, hinges on deep trust from the founding team and intrinsic market knowledge. External hires often fail because they lack the foundational trust to take bold creative risks and the domain expertise to communicate authentically. The role involves representing the company's core identity, making alignment with founders critical.
