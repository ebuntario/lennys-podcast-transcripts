A dedicated 3-5 day strategy sprint is where the core choice of strategic pillars happens. The process involves sharing all prepared insights, enumerating and clustering problems, then reframing problem clusters into opportunity areas. The team then ranks these opportunities on criteria like impact potential and differentiation to select the final pillars.
