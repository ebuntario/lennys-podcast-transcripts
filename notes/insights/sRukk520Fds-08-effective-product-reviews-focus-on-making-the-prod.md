The primary goal of a product review should be to help the team think through problems and improve the product, not to create a scary environment of accountability. Leaders should probe and ask questions, recognizing that the team has deep context, while providing broader business perspective. Framing feedback as ideas or suggestions, not mandates, fosters [[concepts/psychological-safety]] and better outcomes.
