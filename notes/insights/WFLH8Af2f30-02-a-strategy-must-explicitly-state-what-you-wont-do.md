A complete product strategy has three components: a handful of strategic pillars (areas of focus), a list of areas explicitly not the focus, and the rationale for both choices. Defining what you will not work on is as critical as defining what you will, as it enforces necessary [[concepts/strategic-focus|focus]] and prevents resource dilution.
