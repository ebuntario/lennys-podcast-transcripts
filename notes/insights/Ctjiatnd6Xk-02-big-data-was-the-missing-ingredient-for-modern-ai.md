The field of AI was historically focused on algorithmic models but lacked sufficient training data to achieve human-like learning. The breakthrough came from recognizing that [[concepts/ai-training|learning at scale]] requires massive, curated datasets, as demonstrated by the ImageNet project. This shift towards [[concepts/data-strategy|big data]], combined with neural networks and GPU computing, formed the foundational recipe for contemporary AI advancements.
