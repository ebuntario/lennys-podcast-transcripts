For a tool that naturally cultivates power users, it's easy to oversolve for deep, advanced features. It's critically important to counteract this by constantly focusing on early user retention metrics (like D7) and re-experiencing the product as a new user. Regularly signing up from scratch and going through the [[concepts/onboarding|onboarding]] flow ensures the product remains accessible and provides immediate value, which is essential for broad adoption in the early market.
