Team [[concepts/organizational-culture|organizational culture]] exists on a spectrum from highly individualistic (focused on personal achievement and promotion) to collectivist (prioritizing team goals and consensus). Both approaches can succeed when aligned with broader organizational values and regional norms. Understanding where your team falls on this spectrum helps design effective collaboration structures.
