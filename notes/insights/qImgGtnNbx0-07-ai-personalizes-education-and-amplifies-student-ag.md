AI acts as a democratizing force in education by providing a personalized tutor adaptable to any learning style (visual, audio, reading). It can explain complex concepts, quiz students, and offer supplemental instruction, effectively amplifying the agency of motivated learners. The challenge for educators is to adapt evaluation methods for this new paradigm, much like calculus exams changed when graphing calculators were introduced.
