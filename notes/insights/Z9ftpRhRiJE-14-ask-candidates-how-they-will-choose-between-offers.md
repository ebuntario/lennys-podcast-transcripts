A powerful [[concepts/hiring|hiring]] question is to ask strong candidates how they will decide between multiple compelling offers. This forces them to articulate their true priorities (e.g., growth, impact, team). You can then tailor your pitch to highlight how your company uniquely fulfills those specific needs, moving beyond generic selling points.
