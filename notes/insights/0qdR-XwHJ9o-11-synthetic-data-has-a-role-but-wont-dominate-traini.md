While synthetic data is useful in verifiable domains, frontier AI labs indicate it will not replace human-generated data for advancing model capabilities. Human expertise is still required to generate novel insights, break models in advanced domains, and provide trajectories of real-world reasoning. Therefore, demand for high-quality human data will persist for the foreseeable future.
