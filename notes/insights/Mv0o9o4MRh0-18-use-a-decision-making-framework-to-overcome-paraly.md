Product managers and individual contributors can drive decisions without formal authority by adopting a clear framework. Use a model like SPADE or Type 1/Type 2 decisions to explicitly define the decision, criteria, decision-maker, and stakeholders. The key is to follow the process, make the call, and avoid paralysis—often, assuming [[concepts/ownership|ownership]] and creating momentum is better than waiting for perfect clarity.
