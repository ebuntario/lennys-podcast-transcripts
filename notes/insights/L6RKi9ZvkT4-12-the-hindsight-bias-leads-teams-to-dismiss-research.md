The common reaction "we knew that already" to research findings is often a form of [[concepts/hindsight-bias|hindsight bias]]. People reconstruct narratives to fit new information, making insights seem obvious in retrospect. This bias, part of the broader [[concepts/narrative-fallacy|narrative fallacy]], sidelines research value and is a major barrier to teams genuinely learning from user evidence.
