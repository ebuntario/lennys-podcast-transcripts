Major advances occur when researchers identify and address a critical, underappreciated bottleneck—such as the lack of large-scale training data for object recognition. This requires looking beyond the dominant focus of the field (e.g., algorithmic models) to supply a missing ingredient. Successful [[concepts/innovation|innovation]] involves both a clear vision of the problem and the [[concepts/high-agency|agency]] to build the necessary infrastructure.
