Many [[concepts/b2b-sales|B2B SaaS]] tools lack a natural search journey because their purchase process involves committee decisions and sales conversations rather than direct online conversion. SEO only makes sense when users search for solutions they can immediately try or buy online. Before investing in SEO, validate that your target customers actually search for problems your product solves.
