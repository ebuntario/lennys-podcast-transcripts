For important decisions, identify one reason that alone justifies the action. This [[concepts/decision-making|decision-making]] tool counters the tendency to rely on a collection of weak reasons.

This clarifies thinking, reveals hidden strong reasons, and ensures you're not building features based on multiple low-quality justifications.
