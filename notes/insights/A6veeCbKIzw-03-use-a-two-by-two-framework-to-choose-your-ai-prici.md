Evaluate your AI product on two axes: attribution (ability to prove value impact) and autonomy (level of human-in-the-loop). High attribution and high autonomy enable [[concepts/outcome-based-pricing|outcome-based pricing]], the model with the most power. Most companies today use a hybrid model, but the goal should be to architect towards the outcome-based quadrant.
