In high-performing environments, what appears as an [[concepts/strategy-execution|execution]] problem (like team misalignment) is often a deeper [[concepts/strategy|strategy]] or culture issue. For example, teams may be misaligned because the overall strategy is unclear, or because the culture rewards optimizing for individual team OKRs over company goals. Applying execution-focused bandaids (like extra sync meetings) will fail repeatedly unless the underlying strategic or cultural root cause is addressed.
