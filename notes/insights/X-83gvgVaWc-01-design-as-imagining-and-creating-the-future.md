Design is not just about visual expression; it's a holistic [[concepts/design-mindset|design mindset]] of imagining the future you want to live in and taking steps to make it real. This approach involves living with intentionality and accounting for a broader set of constraints than other problem-solving methodologies like engineering or science. It's about creating a cohesive, integrated experience that makes sense as a whole.
