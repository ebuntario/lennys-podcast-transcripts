When A/B testing is challenging due to low sample sizes, start with a power analysis to be honest about detection capabilities and runtime. If a traditional test isn't feasible, use other methods to build conviction: talk to customers, use observational data, analyze twin cities, or adjust confidence thresholds. The key is to avoid false precision; if you can't test rigorously, [[concepts/conviction-building]] through multiple signals is essential before trusting intuition.
