Surface-level feedback on symptoms has limited impact. Using a structured competency framework enables "exponential feedback" with compounding returns. By rating competencies (e.g., Needs Focus, On Track), managers and reports can identify root causes of performance issues. This helps individuals understand underlying behaviors to improve, leading to sustained growth rather than one-time fixes.
