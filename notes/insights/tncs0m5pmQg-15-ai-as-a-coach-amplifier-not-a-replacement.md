The most powerful use of AI in coaching is to amplify human experts, not replace them. For example, AI can analyze participant responses and generate draft feedback suggestions in different styles (action-oriented, sympathetic, inquisitive). The coach then tailors this output, leveraging their personal knowledge of the individual. This approach increases coach efficiency and consistency while preserving the essential human connection.
