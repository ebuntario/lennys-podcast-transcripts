Being a marketplace implies a level of curation; you must be intentional about the [[concepts/supply-quality|quality bar]] you set and maintain. Continuously lowering the bar to add more supply degrades user trust and the overall experience. Companies like Toptal succeed by rigorously vetting supply (e.g., a 3% acceptance rate) and providing coaching to maintain high standards.
