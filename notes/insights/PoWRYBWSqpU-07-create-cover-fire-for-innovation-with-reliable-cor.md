Dedicate a majority (e.g., 70%) of your team's effort to unambiguous, valuable core work to build [[concepts/team-credibility|team credibility]] and security. This [[concepts/team-credibility|credibility]] creates "cover fire," granting the autonomy to use the remaining time for experimental, high-potential "acorn" projects. This balance protects innovative work from being prematurely questioned or shut down.
