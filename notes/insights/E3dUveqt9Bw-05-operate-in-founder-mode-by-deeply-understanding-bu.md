Effective leaders in "founder mode" immerse themselves in the operational and financial details of the business to inform where to intervene. This deep understanding allows you to make informed, selective course corrections on what matters most. You then bring the team along by having them present their strategies and collaboratively refining them, rather than dictating top-down changes.
