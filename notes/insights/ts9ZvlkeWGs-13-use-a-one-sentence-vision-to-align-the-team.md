A powerful alignment exercise is to ask each team member: "What's one sentence you'd want to be able to say at the end of this year that would leave you feeling awesome about our team's work?" Discussing and synthesizing these answers helps build a shared, motivating vision. This process mirrors collaborative creation, like musicians writing a song together, and surfaces what each person values and hopes to achieve.
