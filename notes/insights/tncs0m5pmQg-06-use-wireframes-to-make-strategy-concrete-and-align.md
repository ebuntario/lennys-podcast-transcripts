A strategy described only in words leads to different interpretations. Incorporating [[concepts/visual-communication|wireframes]] into strategy documents acts like an architect's blueprint, creating concrete alignment on what the product will look like when the strategy is implemented. This forces specificity on key trade-offs, such as what belongs in a mobile app's nav bar, and ensures everyone shares the same vision.
