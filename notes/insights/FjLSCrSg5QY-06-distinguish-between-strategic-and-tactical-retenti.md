Retention efforts fall into two categories: strategic (product roadmaps, ICP fit, time-to-value) and tactical (payment failures, cancellation flows, offboarding). Post-product-market fit, tactical issues often account for 25-40% of churn but are overlooked by product teams focused on future features. Fixing these operational issues, like optimizing a cancellation flow, can be a quick win with massive impact.
