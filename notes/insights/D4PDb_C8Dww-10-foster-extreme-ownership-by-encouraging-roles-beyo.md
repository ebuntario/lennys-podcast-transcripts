Cultivate a culture of [[concepts/ownership|extreme ownership]] where team members are expected to solve problems by any means necessary, even if it falls outside their formal role. This means a data scientist might call customers for qualitative insights or help with customer support during an outage. This mindset keeps work interesting and develops versatile talent.
