A common trap with the [[concepts/rice-framework|RICE framework]] is letting low confidence and high effort prematurely deprioritize innovative, high-reach ideas. Ignore confidence and effort initially, spend a week with engineers and designers exploring high-impact ideas, and then reassess. This often reveals a higher-confidence, lower-effort path to achieving the same goal.
