Don't stare at a blank page; start drafting your story and talk about it early. A story is a design tool that's easier to change than a prototype. Test your narrative with others, see how it lands, and [[concepts/iteration|iterate]] based on feedback. Use proven structures like the hero's journey, and decide who the hero is—your team, the user, or the product itself.
