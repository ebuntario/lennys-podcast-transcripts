Treat investor feedback, even when delivered as rejection, as valuable data to strengthen your [[concepts/pitching|pitch deck]]. Each objection—like "your market's too small" or "you're too similar to another company"—is an opportunity to add a new slide that preemptively addresses that concern. This iterative process transforms a chaotic idea into a clear, compelling narrative that eventually finds its audience.
