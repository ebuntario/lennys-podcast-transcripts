Avoid generic online benchmarks for metrics like CPC or CTR. Instead, work with your dedicated platform partners (e.g., at Google, Meta, LinkedIn). They can provide anonymized, industry-specific benchmark data against your named competitors, giving you a realistic view of your performance and where to improve.
