Going direct means the founder or a key leader communicates authentically in a human voice, not as a faceless corporation. Start by choosing the communication medium (e.g., writing, video, audio) that feels most natural to you and invest in building an audience there. This creates a direct channel to prime your market, defend your mission, and tell your unique story better than any intermediary could.
