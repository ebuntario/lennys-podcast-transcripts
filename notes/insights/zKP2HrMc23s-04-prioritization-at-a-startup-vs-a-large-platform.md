At a large platform like Facebook, [[concepts/product-prioritization|prioritization]] often involves managing permanent trade-offs where doing one thing can make another impossible or negatively impact it forever. At a startup like Substack, prioritization is more about sequencing—time is the main variable, and doing something now unlocks the ability to do something else later, with fewer irreversible second-order effects.
