Use a system like "flash tags" (FYI, Suggestion, Recommendation, Plea) to calibrate the importance of feedback. This shared language helps recipients understand the sender's level of conviction, preventing every piece of feedback from being treated with equal weight. It streamlines [[concepts/prioritization|prioritization]] and ensures teams focus on the most critical input.
