The confidence meter is a tool that rates evidence from 0 (pure opinion) to 10 (certainty via rigorous testing). It helps teams move beyond opinion-based debates by classifying evidence types: opinions and themes offer very low confidence, while data analysis and user tests provide higher confidence. This framework empowers teams to challenge assumptions and tie investment levels to the strength of evidence.
