The PSHE framework (Problem, Solution, How, Execution) assesses how someone operates, not just the size of their role. Junior roles focus on Execution, while senior roles define the Problems. This model reveals that mid-career growth is about moving up the PSHE axis, not just managing larger scope. It applies to all functions, from engineering to sales.
