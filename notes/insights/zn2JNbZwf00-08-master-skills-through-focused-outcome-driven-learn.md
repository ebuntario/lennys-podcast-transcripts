Instead of passively consuming content, dedicate a focused period (e.g., 3-6 months) to improving one specific skill. Define a tangible outcome as proof of improvement. Each week, combine study (e.g., analyzing examples) with active [[concepts/deliberate-practice|practice]] toward that [[concepts/goal-setting|goal]]. This concentrated approach builds competency much faster than sporadic learning.
