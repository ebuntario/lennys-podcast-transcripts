Pricing is a critical product decision that must align where the customer derives value with where the company incurs cost. Avoid defaulting to strategies like freemium without a clear reason. Regularly audit and adjust your pricing, as with Vercel's move to unbundle features from an enterprise plan into a self-serve offering, which can unlock significant PLG growth by making high-value features accessible to the right customers.
