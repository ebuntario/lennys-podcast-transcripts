Mid-stage companies that have achieved product-market fit and are transitioning into a platform offer the best environment for skill development. At this size, you receive mentorship, work on a proven product, and contribute to scaling, without the extreme volatility of early-stage startups or the bureaucracy of large corporations. This stage is suitable for both new entrants and experienced professionals.
