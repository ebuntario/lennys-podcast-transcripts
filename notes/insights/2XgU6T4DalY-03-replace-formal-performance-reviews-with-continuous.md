Netflix avoids formal [[concepts/performance-management|performance reviews]] and ratings, relying instead on continuous, real-time feedback. An annual 360-review cycle exists for thematic reflection, but the ideal is for feedback to be immediate and actionable. This approach requires a strong cultural muscle for [[concepts/radical-candor|candor]] to be effective day-to-day.
