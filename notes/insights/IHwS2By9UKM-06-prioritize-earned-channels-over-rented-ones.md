Growth teams should focus on building [[concepts/earned-channels|earned channels]] like [[concepts/virality|virality]], word-of-mouth, and user-generated content rather than over-investing in rented channels (SEO, SEM, social). Owned channels provide sustainable, defensible acquisition that competitors cannot easily replicate. Diversify away from algorithmic platforms where you lack control over distribution.
