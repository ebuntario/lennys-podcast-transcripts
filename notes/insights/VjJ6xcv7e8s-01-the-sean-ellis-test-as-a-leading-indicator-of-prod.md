The [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]] test asks users, "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" It serves as a leading indicator, with 40% of users responding "very disappointed" suggesting strong potential. While actual [[concepts/retention|retention]] is the ultimate test, this survey provides early, actionable feedback before robust analytics are in place.
