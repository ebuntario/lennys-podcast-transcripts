Modern [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agents]] function like collaborative developers, capable of building full-stack applications from descriptive prompts in minutes. They handle tasks from database schema creation to UI implementation, providing a transparent, watchable process akin to pair programming. This allows non-technical roles to create functional [[concepts/prototyping|prototypes]] for validation before committing engineering resources.
