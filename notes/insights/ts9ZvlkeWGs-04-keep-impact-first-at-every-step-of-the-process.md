It's not enough to set an impact-focused goal at the beginning of a quarter; you must consciously keep that goal top of mind throughout strategy, OKR setting, and daily work. Teams often get lost in perfecting intermediate frameworks and lose sight of the ultimate impact they are meant to drive. Regularly ask, "How does this task/initiative/epic contribute to our top-line impact goal?" to prevent [[concepts/goal-setting|cascaded goals]] from drifting into oblivion.
