The goal isn't finding a unicorn with all [[concepts/growth-hiring]] skills at 10/10, but building a balanced [[concepts/team-composition]]. The model evaluates four areas: growth execution, customer knowledge, growth strategy, and communication/influence. Each area has specific competencies that can be assessed through situational and behavioral interviews.
