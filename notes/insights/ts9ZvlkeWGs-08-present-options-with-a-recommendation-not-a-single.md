When pushing back on or aligning with stakeholder requests, avoid simply saying "yes" or "no." Instead, present multiple options with clear trade-offs and a recommended path. This approach helps decision-makers understand the implications (e.g., "If we build your feature, our impact projection drops by X%") and frames the conversation around informed choice rather than conflict. It transforms [[concepts/stakeholder-management|stakeholder management]] from a battle into a collaborative exploration of trade-offs.
