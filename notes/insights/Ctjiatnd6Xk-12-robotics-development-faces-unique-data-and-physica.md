Unlike language models, robots require training data that includes physical actions in 3D environments, which is scarce compared to text or image data. Furthermore, [[concepts/robotics|robotic systems]] must integrate advanced software with mature hardware and real-world use cases, a complex journey evidenced by the 20-year development of self-driving cars. Success depends on innovating beyond just scaling data and compute.
