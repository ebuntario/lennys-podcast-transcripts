The decision to pivot should be based on whether founders still have viable ideas for growth rather than just current performance metrics. If there are still multiple untested strategies for acquiring users or improving the product, it may be worth continuing. However, when founders resort to generic suggestions like "maybe we should pay influencers," that often signals it's time for a [[concepts/pivoting|pivot]].
