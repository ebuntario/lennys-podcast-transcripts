All impact is created through communication, whether verbal, written, or through artifacts. If a team misunderstands a directive or works on the wrong thing for months, the leader must take responsibility for the communication failure. Adopt a mindset of [[concepts/extreme-ownership|extreme ownership]]: when things go wrong, first ask what you could have communicated better.
