Many professionals focus intensely on a single goal, like becoming a vice president or starting a company, without considering what comes next. This can lead to a sense of emptiness or lack of motivation once the goal is achieved, akin to a greyhound that stops running after catching the mechanical rabbit. To build a long and meaningful career, you must think about your "skip"—the job or phase after your current target—and ensure you always have something important and motivating to work toward.
