If you stumble during a presentation, remember that the audience is almost universally on your side and wants you to do well. A minor mistake is humanizing and often forgiven instantly. If you lose your place, simply take a breath, acknowledge it if needed, and pick up where you left off; people are far more focused on your content than on a minor delivery hiccup.
