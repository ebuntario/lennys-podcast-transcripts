Early hires should be willing to handle granular tasks ("little hands") and commit to revenue-focused KPIs, not just top-of-funnel metrics. Assess candidates by their past commitment to bottom-line goals and their adaptability to limited resources. Avoid hiring from large companies unless they have experience scaling from the ground up, as they may struggle without extensive support systems.
