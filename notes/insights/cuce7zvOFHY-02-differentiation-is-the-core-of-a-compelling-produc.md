A product must make a clear, radically differentiated promise to overcome customer indifference in a crowded market. Teams should identify 1-2 unique differentiators that they can actually deliver on and that customers will genuinely value, moving beyond generic attributes like price or speed. This promise becomes a guiding light for all subsequent product and marketing decisions, ensuring the product stands out from alternatives.
