A great [[concepts/company-naming|company name]] can help with word-of-mouth and memorability, but it is only one part of the overall [[concepts/brand-building|brand-building]] effort. A company with a strong strategy and excellent marketing can succeed over time even with a mediocre name, as the meaning of a name is built through consistent execution and customer experience.
