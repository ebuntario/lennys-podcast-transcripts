When taking time to explore a new path, reframe spending savings not as a loss, but as a gift from your past self to your future self. This mindset shift treats the financial runway as an investment in a "life MBA" or a deliberate period of self-discovery. It transforms the narrative from reckless spending to strategic self-investment, making the risk feel more intentional and worthwhile.
