Early in your career, focus on becoming exceptionally good at one thing rather than being a generalist. Working in an environment with clear swim lanes forces you to develop deep expertise that becomes foundational for future roles. This specialized competence is more valuable than being a "professional gadfly" who contributes broadly but superficially.
