The PR/FAQ process uses [[concepts/feedback-loops|concentric circle reviews]] where ideas start with small groups and expand to wider audiences. This iterative refinement allows concepts to be strengthened or discarded before reaching executive levels. Only the strongest ideas progress through all circles, creating natural filtration while maintaining alignment throughout the organization.
