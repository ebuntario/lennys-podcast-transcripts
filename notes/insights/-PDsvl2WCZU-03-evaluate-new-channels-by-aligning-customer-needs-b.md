Before investing in an emerging acquisition channel, assess the overlap between your customers' needs, your company's growth goals, and the channel's inherent strengths.

This alignment check prevents wasted effort on channels that are hot but irrelevant to your [[concepts/strategic-growth-management|growth strategy]].
