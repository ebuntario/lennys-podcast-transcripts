If you're in a Hail Mary situation needing an exit, it's better to be transparent and cast a wider net than to be evasive. Many companies are in this spot, so there's no shame in directly stating you're looking for an exit, highlighting the team and product, and running a process. Use your investor network to find connections, as they understand the long game.
