To find non-obvious solutions, build the most extreme version of a feature along a key trait (e.g., fastest vs. safest). This process breaks you out of default constraints and expands the search space of possibilities. By feeling the trade-offs of these extremes, you can converge on a balanced, innovative solution that wasn't initially apparent.
