Giving users too many filtering options (e.g., car model year, specific equipment) can unknowingly fragment your supply and severely damage [[concepts/marketplace-liquidity|liquidity]] and service levels. Instead of hard filters, use intelligent ranking to surface preferred options while keeping the broader supply pool available. This balances user preference with the health of the overall marketplace.
