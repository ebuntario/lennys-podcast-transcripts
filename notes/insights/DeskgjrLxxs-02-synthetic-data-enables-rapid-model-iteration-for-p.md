Using [[concepts/synthetic-data|synthetic data]] allows teams to teach models core product behaviors quickly and scalably, such as when to trigger a feature or how to edit a document. This method is cheaper and faster than collecting human data, enabling rapid iteration based on user feedback. It shifts the focus to defining correct behaviors and measuring progress through robust evaluations.
