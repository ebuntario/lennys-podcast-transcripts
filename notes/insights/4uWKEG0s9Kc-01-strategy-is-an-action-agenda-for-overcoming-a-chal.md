A [[concepts/strategy-definition|strategy]] is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, not a set of abstract goals. It's more effective to think of it as an [[concepts/action-agenda|action agenda]]—a coherent set of policies and actions aimed at dealing with a specific problem. This reframing moves away from vague ambitions and focuses on what you will actually do.
