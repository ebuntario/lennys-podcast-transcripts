A [[concepts/strategy|strategy]] exercise must result in changed actions—different priorities, resource allocation, or product decisions. If the shiny five-year plan doesn't alter what gets built or how teams operate, it has failed. Always link strategy back to tangible changes in customer experience and outcomes.
