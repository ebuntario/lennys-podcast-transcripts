After a project is shaped, have the build team break it into nine or fewer major implementation chunks. This exercise, done by the builders themselves, quickly reveals if the scope is realistic and creates a shared mental model of the work. It aligns with cognitive limits (the "seven plus or minus two" rule) and fosters ownership, as the team defines their own path to completion.
