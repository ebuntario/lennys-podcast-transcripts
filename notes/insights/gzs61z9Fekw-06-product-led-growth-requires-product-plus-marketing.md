[[concepts/product-led-growth|Product-led growth]] is fundamentally a combination of product and marketing, not a replacement for marketing. Marketing owns one-to-many communication and top-of-funnel channels, while product uses the product itself as a channel. Success requires clear collaboration, especially on the "marketing-to-product handoff" like onboarding, to ensure a consistent user experience.
