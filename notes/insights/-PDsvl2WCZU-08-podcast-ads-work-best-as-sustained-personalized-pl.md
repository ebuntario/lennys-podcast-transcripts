Treat podcast advertising like traditional radio: success comes from selecting the right show, crafting ads that feel native to the content, and repeating them consistently over time. Unlike direct-response channels, podcast ads rarely deliver immediate, scalable volume comparable to Facebook or Google. This approach is especially effective for B2B companies where each customer's lifetime value justifies a [[concepts/brand-building|brand-building]] strategy over pure performance marketing.
