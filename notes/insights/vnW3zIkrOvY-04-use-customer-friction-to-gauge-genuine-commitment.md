In early-stage sales, don't be afraid to introduce friction, like a detailed technical questionnaire, before a proof-of-value. A committed customer will engage deeply, while this process filters out low-intent prospects. This ensures you invest time only with customers who truly want the product and are willing to partner in its early development.
