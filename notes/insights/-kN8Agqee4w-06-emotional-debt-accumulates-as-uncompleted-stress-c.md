When your nervous system experiences stress but doesn't complete the mobilization cycle and downshift, the unresolved energy is stored as "emotional debt" (allostatic load). Over time, this creates fragility, making you more reactive and prone to health issues. Signs include needing substances to relax, disproportionate emotional reactions, and poor sleep.
