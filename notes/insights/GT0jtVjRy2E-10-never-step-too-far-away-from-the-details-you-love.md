As companies scale, there's pressure to industrialize processes and delegate details, but founders should resist stepping too far from their core passion—whether it's product design, engineering, or another hands-on craft. Staying connected to the details that created the initial magic is essential for continued innovation and personal fulfillment, preventing the CEO role from becoming purely managerial.
