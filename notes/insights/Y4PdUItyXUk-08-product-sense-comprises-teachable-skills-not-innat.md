[[concepts/product-sense|Product sense]] can be deconstructed into learnable competencies like systems thinking, problem modeling, and decision-making under uncertainty. Rather than viewing it as a mysterious innate quality, teams should identify and develop these component skills through deliberate practice. This demystification makes product excellence more accessible and teachable.
