Condense your core strategy into a single, testable "founding hypothesis" sentence (e.g., "If we solve X problem for Y customer with Z approach, they will choose it over competitors because of A and B differentiators"). This explicit statement, created during the Foundation Sprint, becomes the basis for [[concepts/hypothesis-testing|structured experimentation]] in subsequent design sprints, allowing teams to learn and iterate rapidly.
