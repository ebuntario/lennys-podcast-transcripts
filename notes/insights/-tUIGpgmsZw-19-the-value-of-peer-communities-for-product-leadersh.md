Communities like Skip, designed for heads of product and CPOs at growth-stage companies, provide invaluable peer support for navigating the unique challenges of the role. These groups act as a "support group" for sharing advice, managing common problems, and preparing for future career steps. They combat the isolation often felt in senior product leadership roles and provide a network for collective learning and growth.
