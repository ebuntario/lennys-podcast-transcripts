The goal should not be to blindly reduce friction or the number of clicks, but to reduce the amount of thinking a user has to do. Making users think has a real cognitive cost (it literally burns glucose) and can make them feel stupid. A better mantra is "Don't Make Me Think," focusing on making actions trivially easy and comprehensible.
