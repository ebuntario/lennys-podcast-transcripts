The core of [[concepts/product-management|product management]] is leadership through influence rather than authority, since PMs typically don't have direct reports. Their primary job is to deliver a product customers love that beats the competition, which requires aligning engineering, understanding the market, and consolidating diverse inputs. This makes the PM role similar to a CEO function within their domain.
