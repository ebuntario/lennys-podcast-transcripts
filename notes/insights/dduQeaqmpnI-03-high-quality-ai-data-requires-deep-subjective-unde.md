Quality in [[concepts/ai-training-data|AI training data]] is not about checking superficial instructions but about capturing rich, subjective, and complex human judgment. For example, evaluating a poem isn't about counting lines; it's about assessing uniqueness, emotional impact, and subtle imagery. This requires building technology to measure thousands of signals on workers and tasks to find the "best of the best," not just filter out the worst.
