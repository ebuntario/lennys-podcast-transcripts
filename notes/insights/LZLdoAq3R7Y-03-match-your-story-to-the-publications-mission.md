Each publication has a specific mission that dictates what stories they run. For example, Entrepreneur focuses on problem-solving insights for business owners, not just entrepreneurial profiles. To succeed, read the publication's content to identify patterns, then frame your story to align with their [[concepts/publication-mission|publication mission]] and serve their audience's needs.
