In consumer products, [[concepts/artificial-intelligence|AI]] alone is insufficient. It must be combined with **HI (Human Intelligence)**—great UX and [[concepts/behavioral-science|behavioral science]]—to be effective. Teams should avoid force-fitting AI as a solution looking for a problem. Instead, start with human-centric [[concepts/product-design|design principles]] and thoughtfully integrate AI to enhance, not replace, the human experience.
