AI development tools will fundamentally reshape [[concepts/organizational-design|company structures]]. Developers may shift from building common UI components to tackling more complex systems, while product managers and designers gain the agency to directly implement their vision. Future teams might have fewer front-end engineers paired with more product/design pairs, all augmented by AI, dramatically changing traditional software team composition.
