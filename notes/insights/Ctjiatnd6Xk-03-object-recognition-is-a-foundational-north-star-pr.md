Humans primarily interpret and interact with the world at the object level, making object recognition a critical building block for machine intelligence. A single object can appear in infinite variations, requiring millions of examples to train a system effectively. Solving this [[concepts/ai-problems|north star problem]] was essential for advancing [[concepts/computer-vision|visual intelligence]], which underpins much of human cognition.
