To achieve breakthrough success and drive word-of-mouth growth, aim to build products that are [[concepts/category-design|fundamentally different]], not just incrementally better.

A fundamentally different product redefines the category on dimensions like quality, complexity, and price, often breaking traditional trade-off constraints.
