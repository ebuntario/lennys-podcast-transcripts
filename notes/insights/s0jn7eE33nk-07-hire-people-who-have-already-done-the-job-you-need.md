Start hiring by visualizing what success looks like 12 months after the person starts—what changes in the business? Then look for candidates with a history of achieving those specific outcomes. This approach, rather than starting with a job description, ensures you hire for [[concepts/role-clarity|impact]] rather than credentials.
