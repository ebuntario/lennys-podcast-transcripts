Effective interviews mix questions from different "courts": home court (specific to your company), away court (about the candidate's past work), and neutral court (hypotheticals unrelated to either). This balance prevents bias and reveals how candidates think across contexts. Neutral court questions, like designing a dashboard for an unfamiliar product, test raw problem-solving ability.
