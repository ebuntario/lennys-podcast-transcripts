For B2C businesses, a modern stack includes Amplitude as CDP/product analytics, Customer.io/Braze for email, Snowflake for data warehousing, Hightouch for reverse ETL, and AppsFlyer/Branch for attribution. B2B stacks share similar components but replace email tools with HubSpot and focus on Salesforce integration. The key distinction is whether the system prioritizes user acquisition (B2C) or company relationship management (B2B).
