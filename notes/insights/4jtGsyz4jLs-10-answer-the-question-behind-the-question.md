When asked something you don't know, avoid defaulting to "I'll get back to you." Instead, probe gently to understand the underlying concern. Offer related information you do have and validate the intent. This keeps the conversation moving and shows [[concepts/systems-thinking|strategic thinking]] rather than just data retrieval.
