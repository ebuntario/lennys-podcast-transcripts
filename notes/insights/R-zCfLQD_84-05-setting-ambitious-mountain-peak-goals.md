Instead of setting goals based on current metrics, start from the inspirational potential of what a product could be. Visualize the ambitious "mountain peak" and the "base camp" starting point, even if the middle path is blurry. This [[concepts/goal-setting|vision-led approach]] is more exciting for teams and creates a higher ceiling for impact than incremental, evidence-based goal setting.
