Map creative messaging to specific stages of the [[concepts/marketing-funnel|customer journey]]. Top-of-funnel assets should generate awareness, while bottom-of-funnel content captures intent. Avoid serving the same ad repeatedly, as this creates banner blindness; instead, design a conversational flow that guides audiences toward conversion.
