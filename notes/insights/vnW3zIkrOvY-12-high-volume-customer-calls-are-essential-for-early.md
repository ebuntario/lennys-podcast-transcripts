Conducting an extremely high volume of customer conversations (e.g., 10-15 per day) is a critical tactic for early-stage idea validation and pivot discovery. This intensive process surfaces patterns in feedback that are invisible at lower volumes. It requires leveraging periods of high accessibility, like remote work phases, to engage typically hard-to-reach buyers.
