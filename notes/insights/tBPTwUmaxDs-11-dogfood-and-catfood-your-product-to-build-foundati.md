Build [[concepts/user-empathy|user empathy]] and product sense by regularly using your own product (dogfooding) and competitors' products (catfooding). Go through key user flows yourself, especially onboarding, to understand the raw experience. This firsthand exposure is a critical foundation that complements formal user research.
