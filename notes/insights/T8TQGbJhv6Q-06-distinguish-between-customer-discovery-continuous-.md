Effective product management involves three distinct feedback modes: discovery (targeted research on a specific workflow), continuous conversation (automated, regular chats set up for PMs and designers), and customer listening (systematically processing signals from churn surveys, NPS verbatims, support tickets, and social media). The latter is crucial but often underutilized, as these signals exist whether you act on them or not.
