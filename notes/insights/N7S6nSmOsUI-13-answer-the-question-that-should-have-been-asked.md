In high-stakes meetings, don't just answer the question that was asked. Elevate the conversation by answering the more important, strategic question that the person *should have* asked. This demonstrates deeper [[concepts/strategic-thinking|strategic thinking]], covers the bigger picture, and introduces alternatives the questioner may not have considered, thereby adding disproportionate value to the discussion.
