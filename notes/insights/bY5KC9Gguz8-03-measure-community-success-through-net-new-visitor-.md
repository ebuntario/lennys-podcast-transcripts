A key metric for community and brand efforts is month-over-month growth in net new visitors to your website. This measures [[concepts/brand-discovery|discovery]]—people motivated to learn about your product—rather than just transactional conversions. Avoid making rigid ROI metrics the sole focus early on, especially when organic momentum is building.
