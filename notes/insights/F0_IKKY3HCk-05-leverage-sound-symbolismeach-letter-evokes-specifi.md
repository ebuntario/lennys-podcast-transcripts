Each letter of the alphabet carries specific [[concepts/sound-symbolism|sound symbolism]] that evokes particular feelings and qualities. For example, the letter 'V' conveys vibrancy and aliveness (e.g., Corvette, Viagra), while 'B' suggests reliability (e.g., Blackberry). Understanding these phonetic qualities allows you to engineer names that subconsciously communicate desired brand attributes before any meaning is attached.
