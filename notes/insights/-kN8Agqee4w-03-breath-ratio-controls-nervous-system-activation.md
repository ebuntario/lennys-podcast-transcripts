You can use breath as an up/down lever for your nervous system. An exhale twice as long as the inhale (e.g., 4-second inhale, 8-second exhale) activates the parasympathetic system for calm. An intense or longer inhale creates activation and energy. This works because the insular cortex monitors [[concepts/breathwork|breathing patterns]] and triggers corresponding hormonal responses.
