The power of the 'working backwards' method (e.g., PR/FAQ) isn't just in defining customer value. It forces you to work backwards from the entire [[concepts/go-to-market-strategy|GTM machinery]] needed on launch day. This includes engineering capacity, marketing commitments, pricing, and compliance sign-offs, creating a single source of truth for [[concepts/alignment|cross-functional alignment]] and exposing feasibility conflicts early.
