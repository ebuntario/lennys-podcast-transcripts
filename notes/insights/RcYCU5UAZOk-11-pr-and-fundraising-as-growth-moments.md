Treat PR and fundraising as intentional growth moments, not just administrative events.

Fundraising rounds can create market moments that drive significant top-of-funnel awareness. The key is ensuring the news is genuinely interesting and aligns with the narrative you want to build for [[concepts/brand-awareness|brand awareness]] and customer acquisition.
