A powerful emerging trend in B2B is unifying self-service product flows with sales-assisted loops into a single, efficient engine. This [[concepts/product-led-sales|product-led sales]] model allows marketing to generate product-qualified leads, sales to engage high-value prospects who need help, and product usage data to inform the entire process. Breaking down these silos creates a more effective and leveraged [[concepts/growth-loops|growth loop]] than optimizing each channel in isolation.
