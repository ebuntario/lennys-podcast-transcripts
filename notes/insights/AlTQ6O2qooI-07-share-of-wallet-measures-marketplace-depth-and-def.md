[[concepts/marketplace-strategy|Share of wallet]]—the percentage of a customer's total spend in a category that flows through your platform—is a key measure of depth and defensibility. A high share of wallet indicates a deeper relationship, reduces multi-tenanting (using competitors), and improves long-term retention. Growing through increased share of wallet is often preferable to acquiring new, shallow customers.
