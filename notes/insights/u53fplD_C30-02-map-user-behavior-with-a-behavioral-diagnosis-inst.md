A [[concepts/behavioral-diagnosis|behavioral diagnosis]] involves mapping every step a user takes to complete a target action, revealing the gap between what people say they will do and what they actually do. This process often shows that requested features (like budgeting tools) fail because the required steps are too cognitively or logistically difficult for sustained adoption.
