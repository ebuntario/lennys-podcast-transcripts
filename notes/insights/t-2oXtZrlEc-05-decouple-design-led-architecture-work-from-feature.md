To achieve a cohesive product architecture, you must give designers dedicated time away from tactical projects. Separating them from the feature grind allows for focused work on system architecture, core building blocks, and consistency. This prevents scope creep from last-minute design improvements and establishes [[concepts/design-strategy|design strategy]] as a key differentiator.
