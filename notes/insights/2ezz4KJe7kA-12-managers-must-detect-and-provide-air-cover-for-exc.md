A key managerial responsibility is to identify high performers who don't need standard processes to excel and then consciously give them "air cover." This means being willing to "break the org" a little for exceptional individuals by granting them special treatment or exemptions from standard procedures, allowing their unique creativity and output to benefit the company without being constrained by averaging forces.
