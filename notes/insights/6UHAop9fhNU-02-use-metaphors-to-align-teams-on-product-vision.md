A powerful [[concepts/product-vision|product vision]] can be communicated through a shared metaphor or feeling. For example, aiming for a product to feel like "sitting in Dolores Park with friends on a sunny Saturday" provides a consistent narrative. This shared story enables autonomous, aligned decision-making across design, engineering, and product teams.
