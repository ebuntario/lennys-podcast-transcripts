The RIDE framework clarifies roles during organizational changes: who is Requesting the change, who can give Input, who is the Decider, and who will Execute. This model prevents confusion by explicitly defining accountability and participation levels for each decision. Applying [[concepts/decision-making|decision-making]] clarity upfront reduces resistance and aligns expectations.
