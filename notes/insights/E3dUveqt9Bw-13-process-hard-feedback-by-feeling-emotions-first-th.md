When receiving hard [[concepts/feedback|feedback]], allow yourself to fully feel the initial defensive or upset emotions without judgment or immediate reaction. Once that wave passes, return to the feedback with genuine curiosity to understand its source and validity. This process of feeling then investigating demonstrates [[concepts/emotional-intelligence|emotional maturity]] and encourages others to continue giving you honest input.
