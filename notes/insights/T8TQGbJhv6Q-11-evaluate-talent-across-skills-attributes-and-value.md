Most companies hire based primarily on skills, but a more complete model assesses three dimensions: skills (what you can do), attributes (personality and proclivities like boldness or timidity), and values (principles and integrity). Incorporating attributes and values into job descriptions and interviews leads to better hiring outcomes and team cohesion, as skills alone are only partially predictive of success.
