Traditional [[concepts/hiring|interviews]] are poor predictors of job performance but can gauge [[concepts/team-culture|cultural fit]] and affinity. To better assess capability, incorporate skill-based tests, trial projects, or behavioral assessments that mirror actual job tasks, providing more reliable indicators of how candidates will perform in the role.
