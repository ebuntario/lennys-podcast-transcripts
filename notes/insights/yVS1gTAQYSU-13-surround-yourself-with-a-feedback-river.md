Smart product managers intentionally surround themselves with a constant stream of diverse feedback—user interviews, NPS data, competitor info, and direct customer requests. This "Feedback River" ensures you are continuously washed over with market information. Use tools and processes, like LLMs summarizing inbound requests or clustering similar themes, to manage this flow and extract common threads without relying solely on your own brain for synthesis.
