Implement [[concepts/user-profiling]] during onboarding with 3-4 screens asking about company size, department, seniority, and use case. Users who drop off due to these questions were likely low-intent anyway and wouldn't have activated. This profiling prevents irrelevant sales outreach and helps identify whether you're dealing with an end user or a potential [[concepts/buyer-personas]], which is critical for effective product-led sales execution.
