With pre-training data sources becoming more standardized, the major differentiator for AI models is now [[concepts/model-training|post-training]], including techniques like [[concepts/reinforcement-learning|reinforcement learning]] from human or AI feedback. This phase is where labs invest heavily to shape model behavior for specific domains and tasks.
