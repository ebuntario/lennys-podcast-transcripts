After an acquisition, proactively ensure your team stays valuable to the parent company. This involves internal marketing, building strong cross-company relationships, and being willing to adapt to shifting strategies while staying excited about the new direction. Founders and early employees should also anticipate a potential post-acquisition existential crisis and seek support, as the transition from startup to corporate life is a significant identity shift.
