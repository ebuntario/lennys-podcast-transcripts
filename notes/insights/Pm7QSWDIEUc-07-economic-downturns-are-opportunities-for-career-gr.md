During economic downturns, when others may slow down, you can accelerate your career by putting your "foot down" and learning more. Companies often have open projects and uncovered responsibilities due to hiring freezes, creating opportunities to raise your hand and take on new roles. This period is about building value and skills that you can monetize later, rather than focusing immediately on title or salary.
