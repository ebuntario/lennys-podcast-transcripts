Creators often overestimate how their audience will react negatively to actions like turning on payments, posting less frequently, or taking a vacation. A paid subscription is a strong signal of trust and support; subscribers are generally forgiving and want to support the creator's sustainability, including allowing for breaks and fair monetization of their work.
