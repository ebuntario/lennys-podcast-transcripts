Consistent, focused work during regular hours often produces better results than dramatic, all-night coding sessions. Creating a culture that values sustainable contribution over performative hustle helps prevent burnout and enables long-term productivity. The most effective contributors are often those who show up, do excellent work, and maintain balance in their lives.
