AI tools are exceptionally good at the lowercase 'c' communication work of synthesizing information and drafting documents, which may change PM-to-engineer ratios. However, the capital 'C' [[concepts/communication|communication]] skills of influence, persuasion, and aligning humans around a bold vision are much harder to automate. PMs should focus on developing these strategic and relational skills while leveraging AI for executional efficiency.
