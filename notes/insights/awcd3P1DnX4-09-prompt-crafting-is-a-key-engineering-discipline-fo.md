Turning a powerful AI model into a usable product involves extensive [[concepts/prompt-crafting|prompt crafting]]—engineering the inputs sent to the model to elicit useful, performant outputs. This involves experimenting with thousands of parameters to optimize for factors like speed, relevance, and code quality, which is distinct from the core model research.
