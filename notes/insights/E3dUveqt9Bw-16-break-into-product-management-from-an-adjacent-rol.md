The most accessible path into [[concepts/product-leadership|product management]] is often through an adjacent function (e.g., engineering, support, sales) within your current company. Your existing domain knowledge and credibility are valuable assets. From there, raise your hand for product-adjacent projects, build relationships with the product team, and seek an [[concepts/internal-mobility|internal transition]], which is easier than changing both company and role simultaneously.
