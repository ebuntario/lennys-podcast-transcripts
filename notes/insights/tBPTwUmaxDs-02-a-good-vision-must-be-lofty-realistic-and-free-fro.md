An effective [[concepts/organizational-product-strategy|product vision]] should feel exciting and slightly scary, yet still attainable. It must be conceived in a vacuum, deliberately ignoring the technical or resource constraints of the present. This approach allows you to work backward from the future to identify what needs to be fixed or built today.
