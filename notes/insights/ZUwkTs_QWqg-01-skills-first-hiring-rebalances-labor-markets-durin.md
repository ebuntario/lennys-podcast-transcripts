During the COVID-19 pandemic, LinkedIn observed that displaced workers in hard-hit industries (like hospitality) weren't moving to sectors with high demand (like customer service), largely because hiring was overly focused on job titles. They championed a [[concepts/skills-first-hiring|skills-first hiring]] approach, translating work experiences into transferable skills to help match people to new roles. This shift helps rebalance labor markets by focusing on capabilities rather than titles, creating more resilient career pathways.
