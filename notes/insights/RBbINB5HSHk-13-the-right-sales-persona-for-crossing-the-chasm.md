Do not hire a traditional enterprise salesperson to cross the chasm; they are accustomed to horizontal coverage and budget-based qualification. Instead, seek someone who resembles a sales engineer—deeply diagnostic, intellectually curious about the customer's problem, and committed to the integrity of the solution. This persona builds trust through understanding, not persuasion.
