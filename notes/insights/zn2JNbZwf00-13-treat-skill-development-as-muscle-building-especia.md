Developing [[concepts/emotional-intelligence|EQ skills]] like listening or managing stress is more like building a muscle than acquiring knowledge. It requires consistent, deliberate practice over a long period and can atrophy without use. Accept that progress is incremental and requires ongoing effort, unlike some IQ skills which can be grasped more quickly through frameworks.
