The fundamental [[concepts/jobs-to-be-done|Jobs-to-be-Done]] framework shifts focus from simply solving pain points to understanding the specific context a person is in and the progress they want to make. Value is created at the intersection of a person's starting situation and their desired outcome, not from the outcome alone. This perspective reveals why people make seemingly irrational choices—the context makes their decision rational.
