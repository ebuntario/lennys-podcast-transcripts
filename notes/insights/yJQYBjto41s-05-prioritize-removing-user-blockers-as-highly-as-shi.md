A dedicated focus on eliminating points of friction is critical for user activation and retention. At Figma, a "Blockers" team systematically addressed these issues, with each fix showing a measurable improvement in metrics. This [[concepts/prioritization|prioritization]] principle balances the need for "awesome" new features with the foundational work that allows users to experience value.
