Effective [[concepts/product-shaping|shaping]] sessions involve a senior engineer (who knows the technical constraints), a product person (who understands the problem and business context), and a designer wrestling together on a whiteboard. The goal is to generate a concrete idea with clear moving parts—like a two-month dot-grid calendar—that everyone understands and believes is doable within the time box. This collaborative upfront work de-risks projects by exposing unknowns before commitment.
