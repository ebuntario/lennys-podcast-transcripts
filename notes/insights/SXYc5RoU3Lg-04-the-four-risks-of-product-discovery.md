Every product solution carries four inherent risks: value (will people buy/choose/use it?), usability (can they use it?), feasibility (can we build it?), and viability (does it work for our business?). The product manager's core competency is to drive the understanding of value and viability, ensuring the team works on something customers will love and that supports the business.
