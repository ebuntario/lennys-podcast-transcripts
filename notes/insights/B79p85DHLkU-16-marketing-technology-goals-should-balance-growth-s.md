Marketing technology teams should align goals with both growth objectives (supporting CAC targets, conversion rates) and efficiency metrics (reducing tool costs per user). The ideal outcome is supporting business growth while decreasing the total cost of tooling per person over time. This dual focus ensures marketing technology contributes to both top-line growth and bottom-line efficiency as companies scale.
