In environments where unconscious bias exists, people often don't receive feedback on presentation or perception because it feels unsafe to give. If you're in a trusted position, offer constructive, respectful feedback on controllable elements like attire or communication—this helps others learn the "unspoken rules." Seek out this feedback yourself to understand how you're perceived and adjust accordingly.
