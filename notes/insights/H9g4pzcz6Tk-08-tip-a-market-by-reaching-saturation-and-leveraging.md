A marketplace tips when it reaches a saturation point in a constrained market and growth becomes easier. This is achieved by identifying and maximizing symbiotic [[concepts/growth-loops|tipping loops]]: growth loops (e.g., seller referrals, buyer invitations) and happiness loops (e.g., search ranking, reputation systems). These loops work together to scale the marketplace and improve the experience for all participants.
