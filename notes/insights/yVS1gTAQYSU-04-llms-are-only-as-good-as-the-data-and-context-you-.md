Large Language Models are powerful synthesis machines, but they are limited by the data they are given and how recent that data is. Information has a rapid decay rate, so the value of customer feedback or competitor intelligence diminishes quickly. Therefore, building a great AI product or experience is fundamentally a [[concepts/data-management|data management]] problem—focusing on accessing high-quality, timely, and well-structured data to feed the model, which is where 90% of the effort lies.
