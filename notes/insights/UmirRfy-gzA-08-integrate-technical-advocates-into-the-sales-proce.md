Sales teams often lack deep product credibility with technical users. Embed a [[concepts/designer-advocates|designer advocate]] (a former practitioner) in sales calls to explain the product, share best practices, and build trust. At Figma, this was called the "Tom Factor" and significantly increased deal closure rates by making [[concepts/technical-sales|technical sales]] conversations authentic and expert-led.
