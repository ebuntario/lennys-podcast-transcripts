Early customers may be polite and supportive without truly needing your product. To avoid this, directly ask them, "If we disappeared, how painful would that be?" or "If a competitor charged half as much, would you switch?" This honest assessment helps determine if your product is a "nice-to-have" or a critical necessity, which is essential for validating nascent product-market fit.
