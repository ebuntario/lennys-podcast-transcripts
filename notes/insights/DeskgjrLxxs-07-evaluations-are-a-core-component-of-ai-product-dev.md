Teams build deterministic and human evaluations to measure model behavior, such as whether a feature should trigger or if an edit is high quality. These [[concepts/evaluation|evaluations]] create ground truth for training and ensure models hill-climb on target metrics without regressing elsewhere. Product managers and researchers collaborate to define ideal behaviors and track progress through structured evals.
