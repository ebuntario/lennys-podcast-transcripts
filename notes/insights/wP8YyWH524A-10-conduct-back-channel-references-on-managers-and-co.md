Treat job selection as an investment of your finite time by conducting [[concepts/reference-checking|back-channel references]] on both the company and your potential manager. Contact former employees who aren't involved in the hiring process for candid feedback. If a company or manager refuses to provide references, that itself reveals important information about their transparency and confidence.
