As [[concepts/ai-training-data|AI models]] have improved, the demand for data labeling has shifted from low-cost generalist labor to domain experts. Frontier labs now require PhDs and master's students to identify weaknesses in advanced STEM, law, and finance domains that average people cannot detect. This creates a structural advantage for platforms with direct access to credentialed experts rather than those relying on broad recruitment.
