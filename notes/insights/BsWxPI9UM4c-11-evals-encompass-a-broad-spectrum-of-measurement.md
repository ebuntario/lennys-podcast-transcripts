Evals is not a single technique but a spectrum of systematic methods to measure AI application quality. It includes error analysis, code-based checks, LLM judges, tracking product metrics (e.g., thumbs-up rates), and A/B testing. The core principle is using data to actionably improve the product, not just running a predefined test suite.
