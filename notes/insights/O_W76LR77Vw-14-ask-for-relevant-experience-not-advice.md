When seeking guidance, don't ask for advice—ask for relevant experience. People will always give advice, but it's often worthless if not grounded in direct, applicable experience. This [[concepts/decision-making|decision-making]] filter ensures you only weight input from those who have actually navigated a similar situation, leading to more credible and useful insights.
