Assume everyone in product, design, and engineering is fundamentally a [[concepts/maker-mindset|maker]] who chose their career to create things they're proud of. They all want to "take it home and show their parents." This perspective fosters mutual respect across functions; your job is to play your position well (like a second baseman in baseball) and trust others to play theirs, embracing the creative tension that leads to a better collective outcome.
