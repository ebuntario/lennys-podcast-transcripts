In interviews, move beyond polished resumes by asking candidates to tell the story of their career, focusing on *why* they made each move. This reveals their decision-making framework, adaptability, and intrinsic motivations. Understanding the narrative behind their choices provides deeper insight than simply listing accomplishments, helping to assess cultural and strategic fit.
