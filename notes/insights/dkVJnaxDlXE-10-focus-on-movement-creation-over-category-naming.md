While [[concepts/category-creation|category creation]] is valuable, over-focusing on a perfect category name can be a distraction. The underlying story and movement are what give power to any category label. A compelling narrative can make almost any name resonate, whereas a clever name without a story behind it will fall flat. The movement is the constant, while categories may change.
