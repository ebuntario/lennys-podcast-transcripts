Instead of choosing between building custom solutions or buying third-party tools, successful companies adopt a [[concepts/build-and-buy|build-and-buy]] approach.

This creates unique solutions while maintaining vendor relationships for core infrastructure, often leading to accelerated outcomes and better cost efficiency.
