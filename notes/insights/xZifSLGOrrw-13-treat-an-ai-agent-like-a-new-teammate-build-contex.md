The most effective way to work with a sophisticated [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agent]] is to treat it like onboarding a new human teammate. Start by ensuring it understands the context (e.g., the codebase), then collaborate to formulate a plan (like a `plan.md` file). Only then delegate specific tasks. This iterative process of building shared context and alignment naturally teaches the human effective [[concepts/prompting-strategies|prompting strategies]] and builds trust in the agent's capabilities.
