To cultivate a strong sense of ownership, leaders must define substantial, independent areas of responsibility that team members can drive and feel excited about. Avoid diluting ownership by over-hiring and splitting scope into tiny, uninteresting pieces. Instead, carve out meaty problems or funnel areas (like activation or monetization) that allow individuals to operate with agency and feel accountable for meaningful outcomes.
