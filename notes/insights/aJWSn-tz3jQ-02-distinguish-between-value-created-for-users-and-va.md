Effective product strategy requires measuring two core things: the value delivered to the market (the North Star Metric) and the value captured back by the business (a top KPI like revenue). For example, WhatsApp measured messages sent (value created), while Airbnb tracked nights booked. This [[concepts/value-exchange|value exchange loop]] creates alignment and focuses the organization on creating genuine user value that ultimately drives business results.
