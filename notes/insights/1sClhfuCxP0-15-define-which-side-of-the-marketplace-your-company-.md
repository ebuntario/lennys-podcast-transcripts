For a marketplace to make coherent trade-off decisions, leadership must explicitly define which side it is **in service of**. For example, Amazon is consumer-centric, while Alibaba's Taobao serves sellers. This clarity, derived from the [[concepts/company-vision|company vision]], dictates priority when conflicts arise (e.g., consumer fees vs. driver pay) and ensures all sides understand their role in serving that primary constituency.
