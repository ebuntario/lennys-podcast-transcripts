[[concepts/product-market-fit|Product-market fit]] has one core metric: retention. If you create real value, customers will come back; if they don't, you haven't found fit yet. For high-frequency products, aim for 30-50% three-month retention as a strong indicator. Once achieved, the core product experience often remains unchanged for years, as seen with Google, Waze, and Netflix.
