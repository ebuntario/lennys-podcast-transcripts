Avoid stating hypotheses as facts ("this will work") or diminishing strong recommendations ("just an idea, ignore it if you want"). Match your language to your actual [[concepts/conviction|level of conviction]] and evidence. This builds trust and prevents teams from over-investing in hunches or under-investing in validated insights.
