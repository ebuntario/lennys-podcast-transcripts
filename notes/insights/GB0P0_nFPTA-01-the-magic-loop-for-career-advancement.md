The [[concepts/professional-growth|Magic Loop]] is a five-step process for advancing your career even with a mediocre manager. First, ensure you're performing well in your current role. Then ask your manager how you can help them, complete whatever they ask, and finally propose a partnership where you take on work that also helps you reach your personal goals. This works because managers naturally help those who help them, creating a win-win dynamic.
