Every person is a unique combination of strengths and weaknesses across infinite dimensions (e.g., coding, presenting, strategizing). Understanding that you are this multi-dimensional profile, rather than being defined by any single trait, makes it easier to receive [[concepts/feedback-culture|feedback]] and pursue growth objectively. Your worth is not tied to any one skill you need to improve.
