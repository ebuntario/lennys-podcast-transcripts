Operating a [[concepts/marketplace-strategy|marketplace]] is akin to gardening, requiring a light touch because you are managing a complex ecosystem with delayed, non-linear effects. Changes to core incentives or mechanisms can have unintended consequences that manifest months later, making them difficult to diagnose. Therefore, founders should tread carefully when altering variables in a working marketplace.
