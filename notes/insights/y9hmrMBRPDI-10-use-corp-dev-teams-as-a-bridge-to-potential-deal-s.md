If a company is active in acquisitions, their corporate development team's job is to meet every potential target. Take that meeting, state you're not currently interested in an acquisition, but push them to introduce you to someone who could sponsor a deal—often someone in product or a GM. Use this as a starting point for partnership conversations.
