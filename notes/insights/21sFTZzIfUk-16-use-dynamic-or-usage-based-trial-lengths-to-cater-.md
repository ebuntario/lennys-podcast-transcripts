Companies of different sizes, complexities, and industries require different lengths of time to properly evaluate a product. Therefore, consider implementing dynamic trial lengths or trials based on usage metrics rather than a fixed time period. This approach better caters to the varied evaluation needs of your customer base and can be tested by, for example, cohorting low-engagement trial users into an enhanced free plan after their trial ends to monitor engagement.
