The core purpose of [[concepts/product-operations|product operations]] is to free product managers from time-consuming operational tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the strategic work they were hired to do. Instead of spending 20-30% of their time on data harvesting or customer interview logistics, PMs can focus on driving company growth and achieving key outcomes. This shift increases the overall leverage and impact of the product management function.
