A simple heuristic for scaling a sales team is the "Rule of Eight." Eight Sales Development Reps (SDRs) need one manager, eight Account Executives (AEs) need a director, and eight directors may need a VP. This rule provides a scalable framework for adding management layers as the team grows, ensuring spans of control remain effective.
