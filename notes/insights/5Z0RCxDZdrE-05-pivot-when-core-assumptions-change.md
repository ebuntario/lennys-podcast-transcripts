A startup must be willing to make a complete, overnight pivot when the core assumptions its original idea was built on become invalid. Don't fall in love with your solution; fall in love with the problem. When new information (e.g., all AI models becoming transformers) disproves your hypothesis, have the courage to change direction decisively.
