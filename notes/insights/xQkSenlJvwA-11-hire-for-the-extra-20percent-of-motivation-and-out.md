For early startup hires, testing for skills is table stakes; the critical differentiator is finding people who will give an extra 20% of effort and are obsessed with the end outcome, not just completing tasks. Screen for this by asking about the hardest they've ever worked and why, and aggressively filter for [[concepts/purpose|mission alignment]] or personal connection to the problem space.
