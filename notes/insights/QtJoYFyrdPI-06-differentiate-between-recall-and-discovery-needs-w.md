Users often use a homepage for [[concepts/recall|recall]] (90% of the time) – resuming sessions or finding known items – not for discovery (10%). A redesign that flips this ratio will frustrate users, even if the discovery tools themselves are good. Use [[concepts/a-b-testing|A/B testing]] and cohort analysis to separate anger over broken habits from legitimate product failures before making permanent changes.
