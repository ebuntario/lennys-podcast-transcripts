Instead of maintaining separate self-service and sales funnels, create hybrid journeys that allow users to move fluidly between both modes based on their needs. This requires rebuilding attribution and measurement systems to value contributions across touchpoints properly, as traditional siloed models will lead to suboptimal investment decisions. The goal is to serve users through their preferred path while accurately measuring the combined impact.
