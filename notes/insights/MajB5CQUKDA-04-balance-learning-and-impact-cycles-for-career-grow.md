Career growth involves alternating between phases of maximum impact (using mastered skills) and phases of [[concepts/learning|continuous learning]] (taking on new challenges). This laddering approach ensures you don't plateau while maintaining consistent value delivery. Someone who is always learning will eventually surpass someone who is an expert today but stops growing.
