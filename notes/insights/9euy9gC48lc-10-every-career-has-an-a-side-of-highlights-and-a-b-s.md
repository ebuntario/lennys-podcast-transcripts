Public narratives often focus only on the "A side"—the impressive highlights and successes—while hiding the "B side" of rejections, layoffs, and uncertainty. Recognizing that everyone experiences these "B moments" is crucial for resilience, as it prevents feeling like an outlier when facing setbacks. Your career is long, and these moments are temporary; the key is to keep moving forward and eventually craft a coherent story from all experiences.
