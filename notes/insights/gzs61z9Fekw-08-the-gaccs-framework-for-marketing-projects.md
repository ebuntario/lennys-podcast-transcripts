Use the GACCS framework (Goals, Audience, Creative Concept, Channels, Stakeholders) as a brief for any significant marketing project or launch. This ensures alignment on the objective, target, unique angle, distribution plan, and key contributors upfront. Sharing this brief early with stakeholders like product managers prevents rework and accelerates the project timeline.
