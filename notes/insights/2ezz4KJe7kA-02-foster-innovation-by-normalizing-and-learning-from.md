Leaders often desire the upside of innovation but are unwilling to accept the inevitable cost: failure. To mitigate this, actively normalize failure by discussing it in public forums and reframing postmortems as positive "retrospectives" focused on learning. This builds [[concepts/psychological-safety|psychological safety]] and encourages teams to take bigger, more creative swings without fear of devastating consequences.
