A highly effective hiring practice is to have candidates join a work simulation for at least a day, sometimes a full week. This provides real-world insight into how they think, collaborate, and solve unorthodox problems. It moves beyond theoretical interviews to assess practical performance and cultural fit within the actual team environment.
