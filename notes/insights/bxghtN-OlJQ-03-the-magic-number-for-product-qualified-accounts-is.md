One of the strongest predictors for a [[concepts/product-qualified-account]] is having seven or more users from the same company. This indicates distributed value across the organization and potential for an enterprise conversation. Creating internal [[concepts/network-effects]] through push/pull mechanisms that encourage users to join existing accounts rather than creating rogue individual accounts is crucial for driving this metric.
