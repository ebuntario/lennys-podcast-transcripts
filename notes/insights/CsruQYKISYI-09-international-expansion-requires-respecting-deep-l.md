Expanding globally is harder than it seems because every country has unique cultural, regulatory, and practical nuances. You cannot simply transplant a U.S. product; you must go deep to understand local context (e.g., tax filing processes) and show respect through localization. Start expansion earlier than you think you need to, as absorbing these lessons takes significant time.
