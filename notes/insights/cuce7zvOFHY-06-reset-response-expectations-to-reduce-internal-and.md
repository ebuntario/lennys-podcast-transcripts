Much of the stress from email comes from our own internal expectation to respond quickly. Proactively reset others' expectations by adding a line to your email signature (e.g., "I check email twice daily to focus on deep work") or using an autoresponder. This simple act of [[concepts/communication-boundaries|setting boundaries]] renegotiates the pressure with yourself and slows the reactive cycle.
