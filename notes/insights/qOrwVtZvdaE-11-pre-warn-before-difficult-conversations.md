Starting a difficult conversation with a warning like "This is going to be a difficult conversation" allows the other person's brain to prepare, reducing the amygdala's surprise-triggered reaction. This small step can prevent the person from being completely gripped by fear or anger, making the subsequent exchange more manageable and productive for both parties.
