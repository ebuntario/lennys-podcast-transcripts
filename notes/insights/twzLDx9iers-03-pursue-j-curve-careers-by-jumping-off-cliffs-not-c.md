The most rewarding careers follow a [[concepts/j-curve-careers|J-curve]]: you take a role you're deeply unqualified for, experience a 6-9 month "fall" where you feel incompetent, and then climb to a capability level far beyond a traditional stair-step promotion path. This [[concepts/risk-taking|risk-taking]] accelerates self-knowledge and unlocks skills no one would have hired you for initially, proving to yourself what you're capable of.
