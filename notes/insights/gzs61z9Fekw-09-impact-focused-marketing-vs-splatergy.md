Effective marketing teams are impact-focused, not activity-focused. They can articulate their core work that drives linear growth, their big bets for step-change growth, and the foundational fixes needed. They track funnel [[concepts/performance-measurement|conversion rates]], not just raw top-of-funnel numbers, and avoid vanity goals like "write 10 blog posts" in favor of outcome-based metrics.
