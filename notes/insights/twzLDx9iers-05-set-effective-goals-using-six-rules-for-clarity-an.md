Effective [[concepts/goal-setting|goal-setting]] follows six rules: 1) No company needs more than three top-level goals. 2) One goal must "win in a fight" for prioritization. 3) An intern should understand them (explain like I'm five). 4) Strategy should hurt—make painful trade-offs. 5) One goal, one owner (clear accountability). 6) Goals alone aren't enough; build a process for follow-up and learning. This turns goals from a spreadsheet into a communication tool that drives clarity.
