Skipping the practice of dogfooding—using your own product—can lead to shipping "super lame" features that fail because the team never experienced them firsthand. Even with rigorous hypothesis prioritization, failing to internally test an implementation can waste months of development time. Making dogfooding a standard part of the [[concepts/product-development|product development]] process provides immediate, visceral feedback that can prevent costly mistakes and misguided launches.
