A [[concepts/growth-loops|growth model]] is a spreadsheet-based tool that forces a concrete understanding of how a business grows by linking key components like acquisition, retention, and monetization. Its primary value lies in the process of building it, which uncovers how the system works, rather than in precise forecasting. This artifact then serves as a crucial framework for opportunity assessment and resource allocation during planning.
