Maintain momentum with weekly planning sessions that identify focus areas for the coming week, followed by demos of what was shipped. Use simple tools like FigJam boards to visualize problems and priorities rather than elaborate roadmaps. This cadence keeps teams aligned while allowing flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.
