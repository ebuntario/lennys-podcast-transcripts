[[concepts/ai-content|AI-generated content]] excels at creating structured content like product descriptions or data summaries but often fails at valuable editorial content. Use AI to enhance useful content rather than generating generic blog posts. Google evaluates content based on helpfulness, not whether it was AI-generated, so focus on solving user problems.
