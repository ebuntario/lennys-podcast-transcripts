For free consumer products, aim for a cohort [[concepts/customer-retention|retention]] rate of around 60% from week one, with the curve flattening thereafter.

Early-stage products should see even higher rates (e.g., 80%) among friends and family, as this signals initial [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]].
