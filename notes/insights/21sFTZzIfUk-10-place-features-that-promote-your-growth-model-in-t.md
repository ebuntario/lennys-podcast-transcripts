A guiding principle for [[concepts/freemium-strategy|freemium plan design]] is to place features that promote your growth model in the free tier and reserve features that add friction or have a high cost of service for paid plans. You should have a clear understanding of the target customer and use cases for each plan and map out the motivations for moving between them. Regularly challenge and reevaluate your packaging model, as what was best in the past may not be optimal now or in the future.
