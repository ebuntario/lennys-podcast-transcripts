The shortest version of a story is usually the best version. Begin as close to the pivotal moment as possible, omitting irrelevant context like vacation details unless they are essential to the transformation. This principle, echoed by Kurt Vonnegut, ensures you engage the audience immediately without unnecessary setup.
