Leaders should actively encourage their teams to "play" with AI products—blocking out days or even weeks for exploration. This psychological shift from task-oriented use to curious exploration is crucial for learning. Sharing personal experiments and prototypes, rather than polished memos, models this behavior and helps the team understand what's possible.
