You cannot rely on willpower to avoid [[concepts/distraction-management|distractions]] like social media or email because these are designed as "infinity pools" to be endlessly engaging. Instead, create deliberate friction: log out of apps, delete them from your phone, or use browser extensions to block feeds. This puts a speed bump between you and the distraction, making it easier to choose your highlight.
