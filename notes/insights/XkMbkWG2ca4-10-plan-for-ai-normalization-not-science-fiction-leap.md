When planning for future AI capabilities, assume new models will become powerful but normalized tools, not magical solutions. Building products for a world where advanced AI is a reliable, integrated part of workflows is a smarter strategy than betting on discontinuous, science-fiction leaps. This mindset focuses on solving persistent human problems with better tools.
