True product-led growth is often community-led or champion-led. The goal is to empower passionate internal users within a customer company to advocate for your product. Sales and product teams should partner to equip these champions with data, stories, and connections, turning them into superheroes who drive internal adoption. This model focuses on enabling human connections rather than just top-down selling.
