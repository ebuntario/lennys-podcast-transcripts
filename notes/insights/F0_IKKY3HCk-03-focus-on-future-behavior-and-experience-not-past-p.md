Traditional naming approaches that focus on mission, values, or positioning are outdated. Instead, start by discussing how your brand behaves now and how you want it to behave in the future, considering the bidirectional relationship with the marketplace. This focus on [[concepts/behavior-and-experience|behavior and experience]] opens creative possibilities and leads to names that create tangible future experiences rather than just describing the past.
