Focus on win rate (deals closed / qualified opportunities) alongside outbound conversion rate. If your win rate is high (e.g., 30-40%), you don't need an exceptionally high outbound conversion rate because your pipeline throughput is healthy. Conversely, a low win rate demands a much higher volume of leads to hit targets.
