Effective AI development tools offer a spectrum of automation, from high-agency [[concepts/ai-agents|agents]] that autonomously execute broad projects to fast, controllable assistants for precise, incremental changes. The agent acts like a developer given a PRD, while the assistant is like a pair programmer enabling quick, reliable iterations. This gives users appropriate levels of [[concepts/user-control|control]] based on the task.
