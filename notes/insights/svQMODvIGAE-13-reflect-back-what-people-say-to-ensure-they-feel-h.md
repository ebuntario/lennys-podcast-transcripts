As a facilitator, reflect back what someone said without offering your own opinion. Say, "What I heard you say is... Is that what you meant?" This simple act of [[concepts/communication|communication]] makes people feel profoundly heard and understood, increasing their buy-in to the final decision, even if it doesn't go their way.
