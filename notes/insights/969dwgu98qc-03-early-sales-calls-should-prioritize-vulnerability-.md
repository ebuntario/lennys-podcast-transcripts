On initial sales calls, be vulnerable and honest about being an early-stage startup. Frame the conversation around gaining the prospect's insight into how a problem manifests for them, which yields more raw and honest feedback than presenting a "fully baked" product. This approach turns the call into a [[concepts/customer-development|customer development]] session to learn if the problem is truly felt and how they've tried to solve it.
