As the cost and effort of building software decrease, the total volume of software created will increase, similar to the [[concepts/ai-productivity|Jevons Paradox]] in economics. When the activation energy to build is lower than hiring a developer, people will materialize more ideas they previously wouldn't have pursued. This shift turns the primary bottleneck from execution speed to the rate of [[concepts/idea-generation|idea generation]].
