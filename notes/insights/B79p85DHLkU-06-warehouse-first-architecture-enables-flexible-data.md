Modern marketing technology stacks increasingly adopt a warehouse-first approach where all data flows into a central data warehouse like Snowflake.

This architecture provides unlimited schema flexibility compared to traditional CDPs while maintaining the ability to leverage third-party tools for specific activation needs.
