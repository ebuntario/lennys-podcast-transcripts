Most meetings fail because they skip the priming step and jump straight to decision-making. Effective priming involves clarifying the meeting's purpose, the category of conversation, and the core principles that apply (e.g., are we seeking speed or accuracy?). Doing this, even briefly in the invite, aligns everyone and prevents debates rooted in misaligned objectives, dramatically improving [[concepts/meeting-effectiveness|meeting effectiveness]].
