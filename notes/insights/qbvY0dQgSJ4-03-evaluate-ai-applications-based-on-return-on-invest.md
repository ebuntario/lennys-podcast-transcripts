The decision to invest in formal [[concepts/evaluation|evaluation]] for an AI feature should be based on its potential return and associated risk. For core features with catastrophic failure modes or competitive advantage, rigorous evals are essential. For peripheral features, a "good enough" vibe check may suffice, allowing resources to be allocated to new functionality.
