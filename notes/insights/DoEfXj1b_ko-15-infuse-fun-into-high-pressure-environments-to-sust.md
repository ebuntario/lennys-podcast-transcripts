In high-pressure, results-driven environments, intentionally infusing fun is crucial for maintaining team morale and preventing burnout. Encouraging a culture where people don't take themselves too seriously helps balance the intensity of chasing ambitious goals. This fosters psychological safety and makes the challenging work more sustainable and enjoyable for everyone involved.
