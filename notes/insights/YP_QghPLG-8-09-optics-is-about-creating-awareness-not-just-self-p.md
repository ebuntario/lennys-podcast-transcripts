[[concepts/optics|Optics]]—creating awareness of impact and execution—is a necessary part of product work. Done well, it builds energy, enables feedback, and fosters alignment.

Leaders should model balanced behavior, appreciating outcomes rather than just polished communications, to prevent optics from becoming the goal itself.
