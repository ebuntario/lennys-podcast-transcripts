The strongest signal for a new [[concepts/product-opportunity-identification|product opportunity]] is observing people trying to obtain a particular value through a very distortive process. For example, the number one app in the US being entirely in Arabic indicated a massive unmet need. If you can crystallize the core motivation and build a product that simplifies that process, you can achieve intense adoption.
