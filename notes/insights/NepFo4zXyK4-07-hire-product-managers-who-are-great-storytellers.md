A key trait to look for in product managers is strong [[concepts/storytelling|storytelling]] ability. This includes the power to synthesize disparate information into a coherent narrative and to make a problem compelling enough to rally a team. During interviews, ask candidates to describe a controversial product decision to see if they can articulate the conflict and multiple perspectives clearly.
