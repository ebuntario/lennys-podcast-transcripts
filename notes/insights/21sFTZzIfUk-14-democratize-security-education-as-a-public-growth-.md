Providing high-quality, bite-size security education lessons in the public domain, without a paywall, can serve as an effective [[concepts/community-led-growth|community-led growth]] loop. Snyk builds lessons about developer security vulnerabilities and surfaces them publicly, which differs from traditional solutions that gate this content. This approach not only helps democratize security knowledge but also drives acquisition by attracting developers searching for solutions, building trust, and positioning the company as an authority.
