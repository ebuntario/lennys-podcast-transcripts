Founders and product leaders should present problems to their teams, not dictate feature solutions. Empower engineers, designers, and PMs to brainstorm options, prioritize based on impact, and own the outcome. This prevents a "feature factory" culture and ensures the team is focused on changing customer behavior, not just shipping code.
