During planning, provide clear guidance on how team capacity should be allocated across different work types. A useful heuristic is to allocate roughly 60% to incremental improvements (high ROI), 30% to big new initiatives (minimizing opportunity cost), and 10% to stability and infrastructure. This ensures teams don't just fill their roadmap with quick wins but reserve bandwidth for ambitious, transformative projects.
