Use a translation layer to connect all team-level metrics to a single company [[concepts/north-star-metric|north star metric]]. Each team optimizes for a metric they can directly influence, but for planning and resource allocation, you translate their impact into the common north star currency. This framework simplifies cross-team prioritization by showing the impact per dollar or engineer, even though the translations are directional guides, not perfect formulas.
