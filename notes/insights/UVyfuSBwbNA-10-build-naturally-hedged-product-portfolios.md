In sectors like banking, you can build a [[concepts/product-strategy|product portfolio]] that naturally hedges against macroeconomic shifts. For example, when interest rates are high, savings products attract users; when rates fall, lending products become more attractive. This creates a self-hedged business that performs more consistently through economic cycles.
