A strong company culture is defined by who it is for and who it is *not* for, with values that involve real trade-offs. For example, a culture that emphasizes "assuming the most charitable interpretation" in conflicts actively filters out individuals who default to zero-tolerance or adversarial responses. This clarity must be front-loaded in the [[concepts/hiring|hiring process]] to ensure alignment and avoid costly mismatches.
