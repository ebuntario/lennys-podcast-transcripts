When researching high-spending "whale" users at Tinder, the team discovered they weren't high-net-worth individuals but people with intense dating needs (e.g., military, sales). These users framed the cost of Tinder's premium features not against other subscriptions but against the cost of traditional dating (e.g., $200 for a few dinners).
