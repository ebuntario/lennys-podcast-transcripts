The [[concepts/product-trio|product trio]] (product manager, designer, engineer) should decide together, moving beyond siloed roles and internal politics. When disagreements arise, view them as signals that you haven't found the best option yet, and continue exploring together. This collaborative approach, grounded in shared customer understanding, leads to better products than hierarchical decision-making.
