Not all decisions are permanent "trapdoor" (one-way door) choices. Rigorous thinking should be applied to distinguish these from reversible decisions. For example, pricing is often seen as irreversible, but you can grandfather existing users, making it a two-way door. Applying this [[concepts/decision-making-framework|framework]] allows teams to move with urgency on lower-stakes choices while reserving deep deliberation for truly permanent commitments.
