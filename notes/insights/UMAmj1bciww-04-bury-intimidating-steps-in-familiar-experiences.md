For complex products, users may be psychologically blocked by intimidating but necessary steps. The solution is to "pill the hotdog"—embed the scary step within a familiar, comfortable experience. For example, instead of starting onboarding with a complex telecom configuration, first place users in a familiar documentation environment with code samples, then sneak in the necessary configuration. This respects the user's [[concepts/user-psychology|psychological state]] and improves progression.
