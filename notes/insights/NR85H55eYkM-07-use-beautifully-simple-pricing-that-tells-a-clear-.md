Early-stage pricing should be simple enough that a customer can easily explain it to someone else. Your [[concepts/pricing-strategy|pricing strategy]] must tell a clear value story, like Superhuman framing $30/month as "a dollar a day for four hours of productivity back." This contextualization helps customers internalize the value exchange.
