The first slide of your pitch deck is displayed the longest and is where investors form their first impression. Place your strongest point here—whether it's the market size, the problem, or your traction—to capture attention immediately. The second most important slide is the last one ("Thank you"), as it's also displayed for a long time; use it to reiterate your key message. This [[concepts/pitch-decks|slide strategy]] maximizes impact during critical moments.
