True [[concepts/virality|virality]] is not synthetic tactics but high-quality word-of-mouth driven by customers. The foundation is building a great product that solves a sharp problem exceptionally well; if the product is mediocre, any viral tactic will ultimately fizzle. Slack succeeded not through forced sharing but because its great product made people at lunch rave about it to colleagues.
