Products that feel like [[concepts/magic-trick|magic]]—where users can't immediately understand how the technology works—often drive word-of-mouth and rapid adoption. Achieving this requires fine-tuning performance, scoping down features, and iterating until you cross the threshold from "impressive" to "magical." This initial delight, though it may fade, is a powerful catalyst for growth.
