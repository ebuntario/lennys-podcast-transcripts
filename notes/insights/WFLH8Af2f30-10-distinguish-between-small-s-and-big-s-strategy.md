"Small s" strategy is present-forward, problem-focused, and operates on an ~2-year horizon, typically led by product. "Big S" strategy is future-backward, aspirational, and explores 5-10 year futures, often led by design and research. A company's roadmap should be built from both streams, like building a bridge from both sides of a river.
