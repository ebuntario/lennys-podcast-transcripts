When a team's output seems low, a simple, non-accusatory starting question is, "What did you deliver this sprint?" Follow-up questions about what shipped to production, cycle time, and time spent help diagnose the root cause. This approach focuses on tangible [[concepts/strategy-execution|execution]] and seeks to understand complexity rather than assign blame.
