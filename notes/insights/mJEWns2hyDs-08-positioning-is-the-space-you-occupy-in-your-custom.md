[[concepts/positioning|Product positioning]] is how you want your target audience to understand your product and its role in their lives. You have a positioning problem if customers or employees give widely different descriptions of what you do. Effective positioning starts with defining a specific target audience and a model user persona, then articulating the problem you solve and how you are different.
