Investing in [[concepts/team-culture|team culture]] builds trust and makes work more fun, creating durable passion that survives roadmap changes. Simple, low-cost rituals like "hot seat" (asking anyone anything) or an Oscar-style awards ceremony ("Figgies") help teams connect personally. This emotional connection ensures that during tough times, the team's instinct is to rally together rather than fracture.
