Before the chasm, you sell to visionaries who say, "We believe what you believe," and are excited by the technology and vision. After the chasm, you sell to pragmatists who say, "We need what you have," and make risk-averse, peer-influenced decisions. A visionary reference is useless to a pragmatist, who sees them as reckless and not a true peer, creating the core [[concepts/chasm-crossing|chasm-crossing]] challenge.
