To prevent disjointed product launches, adopt the Amazon practice of writing the press release at the beginning of the ideation phase. This "start with the end in mind" approach forces teams to define the core theme and customer outcome before building. It ensures the final product is marketable and resonant, rather than a "bag of doorknobs" that marketing must struggle to package.
