Make [[concepts/continuous-discovery|continuous discovery]] sustainable by automating customer recruitment so interviews appear on your calendar without effort. Use product intercepts (like embedded surveys asking "Do you have 20 minutes to talk?") for B2C/end users, or leverage sales/support teams to recruit B2B buyers. This removes friction and builds the habit of weekly customer conversations.
