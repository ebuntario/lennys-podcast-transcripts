External obstacles like systemic bias or criticism are small compared to the damage you do to yourself by believing negative narratives. The key to overcoming almost anything is rejecting external definitions and maintaining the belief that "that's not me." Your internal psychology and self-belief ultimately determine your trajectory more than external circumstances.
