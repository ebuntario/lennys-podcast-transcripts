The atomic unit of effective OKRs is asking "What am I doing this week to get closer to our goals?" This question prevents the "tomorrow problem" where important work gets perpetually delayed. By focusing on weekly progress toward meaningful [[concepts/outcome-orientation|outcomes]], teams maintain momentum and avoid getting lost in day-to-day tasks.
