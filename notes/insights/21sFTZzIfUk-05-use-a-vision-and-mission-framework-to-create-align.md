A useful framework defines a **vision** as the nirvana state for users in 5-10 years (solution-agnostic) and a **mission** as what you will relentlessly iterate on to get closer to that vision. This framework can be applied from the company level down to individual teams to create clear, aligned [[concepts/strategic-alignment|strategic statements]]. For example, Snyk's growth group vision is "every developer securely unleashes their creativity," and its mission is "to connect every developer and their organizations to the value of the Snyk platform with frictionless self-serve adoption and expansion."
