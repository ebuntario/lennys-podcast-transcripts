Having product management and design report to the same leader (like a CPO) fosters a holistic view of the end-to-end user experience. This structure helps integrate the work of prioritizing problems (PMs) and designing solutions (designers) more seamlessly. While other structures can work, this consolidation at scale can ensure all pieces of work are better integrated to deliver a superior customer experience.
