Create a culture that is both team-first and results-oriented by encouraging collaboration while maintaining clear individual ownership. Leaders set the tone by helping connect team members to opportunities, sharing context, and personally stepping in to help other teams. This demonstrates that collective success and helping others are valued, even when individual impact metrics are clear, preventing a hyper-competitive environment.
