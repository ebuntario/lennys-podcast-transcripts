Invention isn't purely spontaneous; it requires dedicated, focused thinking time. You only need a few hours periodically to generate valuable ideas, as the real work lies in the years of [[concepts/execution|execution]] and optimization that follow. Most innovation comes from combining existing concepts in new ways rather than creating something entirely from scratch.
