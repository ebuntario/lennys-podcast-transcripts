When teams optimize for local [[concepts/conversion-optimization|conversion rates]] within a funnel stage, they often inadvertently make the preceding step harder, which artificially inflates their metric. Instead, teams should focus on increasing the absolute number of people who successfully complete their stage, which often means making it easier to enter the funnel in the first place. This approach aligns incentives towards overall growth rather than local optimization that can harm total acquisition.
