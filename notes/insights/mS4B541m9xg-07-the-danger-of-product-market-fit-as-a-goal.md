The concept of "product-market fit" is dangerous because it implies fitting your product into an existing market, which is the essence of the "Better" Trap. True legendary success comes from designing a market category *for* your product, not fitting your product into a pre-existing one. Categories make products, not the other way around. Aim to create a new category where your product is the inevitable and only logical solution.
