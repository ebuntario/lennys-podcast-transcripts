Unlike vague principles, [[concepts/design-tenets|design tenets]] are specific, memorable decision-making tools that help teams avoid recurring debates. Examples include "documentation is a failure state" or "the entire product should look and feel like it came from a single mind." To create them, identify debates where the team bifurcates into two camps, decide the direction once as an organization, and encode it into a tenet to move forward efficiently.
