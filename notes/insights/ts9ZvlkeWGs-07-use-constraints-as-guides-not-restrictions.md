Common constraints like industry regulations, B2B models, or quarterly targets are often seen as impediments to "proper" product management. Instead, view these as the defining parameters that shape your product strategy and create commercial advantage. Working *with* these realities, rather than fighting against them, allows you to build a product strategy that is uniquely suited to your company's context and success metrics.
