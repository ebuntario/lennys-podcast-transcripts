Paid channels are not just for efficient user acquisition; they are also a powerful tool for rapid, scalable learning. You can use them to A/B test headlines, messaging, positioning, and even new feature concepts quickly. The key is to be clear about whether the budget is for learning or for scalable growth, and to ensure experiments are run properly to extract insights.
