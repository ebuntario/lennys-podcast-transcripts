If you have a demanding primary job, strictly time-box side activities like angel investing. Dedicate a fixed, limited number of hours per day (e.g., 2-3 hours) for meetings and outreach. Use calendar blocking, standardize your questions, and develop the ability to compartmentalize conversations to manage mental load effectively without burnout.
