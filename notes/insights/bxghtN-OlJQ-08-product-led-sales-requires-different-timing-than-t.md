The average time from individual sign-up to enterprise contract is 12+ months, requiring patience in [[concepts/product-led-sales]] outreach. Treating new sign-ups as immediate sales opportunities creates channel saturation and user frustration. Instead, align outreach with when accounts enter [[concepts/product-qualified-account]] status, and be prepared to sunset efforts if contact isn't made, waiting for the next PQA moment.
