Sophisticated [[concepts/growth-strategy|growth strategies]] like A/B testing and analytics are counterproductive for companies with few or no users. Early-stage founders should study how successful companies acquired their first thousand customers rather than their current scaled tactics. For consumer apps, this might mean focusing on specific communities (like Facebook starting at Harvard) rather than broad marketing campaigns.
