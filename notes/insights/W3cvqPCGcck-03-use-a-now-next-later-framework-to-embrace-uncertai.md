A [[concepts/now-next-later-roadmap|Now, Next, Later roadmap]] replaces rigid timelines with flexible time horizons, acknowledging that certainty decreases the further out you plan. This approach allows teams to communicate intent and priority without being penalized for not hitting arbitrary dates on every item. It aligns with the natural [[concepts/cone-of-uncertainty|cone of uncertainty]] inherent in product development.
