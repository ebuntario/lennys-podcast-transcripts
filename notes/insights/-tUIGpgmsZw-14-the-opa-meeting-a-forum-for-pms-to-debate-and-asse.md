An "OPA" (Opportunity/Problem Assessment) meeting is a dedicated forum for product managers to debate, discuss, and spar with each other on potential problem spaces or evaluated opportunities. Leadership intentionally stays out to foster open, judgment-free dialogue. This practice helps PMs think through challenges, get peer feedback, and decide whether to move forward with investigating or solving a problem.
