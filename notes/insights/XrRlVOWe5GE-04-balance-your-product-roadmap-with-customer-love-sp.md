Maintain a diversified product portfolio that balances big bets with incremental improvements. Operationalize the latter through quarterly "Customer Love Sprints"—dedicated two-week periods where teams focus exclusively on shipping low-effort, high-impact improvements. This ritual generates delight, provides a fun change of pace from long-term feature work, and ensures a steady stream of polish reaches users.
