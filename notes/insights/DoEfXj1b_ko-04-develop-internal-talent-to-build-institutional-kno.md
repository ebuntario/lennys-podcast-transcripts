Investing in developing existing team members is both a personal passion and a strategic advantage for scaling companies. Internal talent accumulates valuable institutional knowledge and user context, similar to founder intuition. Promoting from within creates smoother transitions and de-risks growth compared to bringing in external experts who must ramp up on company-specific nuances and culture.
