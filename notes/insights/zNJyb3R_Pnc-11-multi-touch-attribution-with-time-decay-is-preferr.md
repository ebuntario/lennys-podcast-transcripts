Favor multi-touch attribution models, particularly time decay, over last-click. This gives some credit to early touchpoints (like brand awareness) but more credit to interactions closer to conversion, reflecting how users actually discover and decide. Recognize that all attribution is biased and should be complemented with incrementality testing.
