A compelling [[concepts/product-strategy|product vision]] is essential because the product development cycle is inherently messy and chaotic. Having a shared vision of what the world looks like if the team succeeds anchors everyone and turns setbacks into learning opportunities rather than discouragement. This shared belief creates forward momentum even when the path is unclear.
