Avoid redesigning onboarding for its own sake; only revisit it when you've gained new fundamental [[concepts/customer-insights|customer insights]] or discovered aspects of your growth model that onboarding can influence. Once onboarding is in a good foundational state, micro-optimizations rarely move the needle significantly. Major updates should be driven by hard-earned, net-new insights about user behavior.
