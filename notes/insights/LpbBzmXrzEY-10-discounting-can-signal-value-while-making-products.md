Strategic discounting uses a high list price to signal quality and value while making products accessible through temporary price reductions. This approach taps into both the aspirational nature of certain purchases (like education) and the [[concepts/consumer-psychology|psychological satisfaction]] of getting a deal. When executed well, discounts can help users overcome uncertainty about a product's value while creating urgency that drives conversion.
