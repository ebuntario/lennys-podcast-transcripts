Audiences cannot see your internal insecurities, so [[concepts/self-sabotage|leaking them]] by saying "I'm not making sense" forces them to view you through a lens of doubt. Staying in character from start to finish, even through mistakes, makes you appear confident and reinforces a positive feedback loop. This habit builds genuine confidence as you receive reactions meant for a confident speaker.
