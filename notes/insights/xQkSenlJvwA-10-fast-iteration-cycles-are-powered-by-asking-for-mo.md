A key principle for fast iteration is to ask a potential customer to pay a significant amount of money for a solution very early in the process. This "why feed, why see" test provides the strongest possible [[concepts/validation|validation]]. If they won't pay, you quickly learn and pivot, rather than spending weeks building in a vacuum based on assumed interest.
