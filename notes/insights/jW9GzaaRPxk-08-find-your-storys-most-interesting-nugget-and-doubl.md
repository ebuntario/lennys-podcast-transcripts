Instead of pitching all company news, identify the single most compelling angle—like a unique founder story, a social impact initiative, or a direct challenge to a major incumbent—and build your [[concepts/media-strategy|press strategy]] around it. This focused narrative is more likely to resonate with reporters than a broad overview of company metrics.
