Good process speeds up a company, especially in hyper-growth. Establish transparent forums (like a weekly Marketing Review) for alignment. Use two key checkpoints: a 20% review to align on strategy, audience, and approach, and an 80% review on near-final artifacts. This ensures [[concepts/brand-consistency|brand consistency]] and allows for substantive feedback before launch, without creating bottlenecks.
