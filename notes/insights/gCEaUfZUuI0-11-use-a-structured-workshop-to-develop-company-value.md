To develop [[concepts/company-values|company values]], facilitate a workshop where team members brain dump ideas, group them into themes, and vote on the most important concepts. After this collaborative filtering, a skilled writer should draft clear, memorable definitions for the shortlisted values, which are then refined through group feedback.
