Trying to stop or control the negative inner voice is ineffective. Instead, experiment daily with new ways of relating to it, such as responding with, "I see you're really scared. I'm right here with you." This [[experimental-mindset|experimental approach]] turns interactions into learning opportunities and prevents the discouragement of perceived failure.
