The [[concepts/opportunity-solution-tree|opportunity solution tree]] provides scaffolding to shift teams from output-focused feature delivery to outcome-oriented product development. It starts with a business outcome at the root, then branches into customer opportunities (unmet needs, pain points, desires), and finally into potential solutions. This visual framework helps teams manage the complex, unstructured problem of deciding what to build to achieve desired outcomes.
