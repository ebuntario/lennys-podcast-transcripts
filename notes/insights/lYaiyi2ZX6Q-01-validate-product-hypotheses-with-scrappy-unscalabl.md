The best data comes from testing actual user experiences, not just theoretical models. Teams can use [[concepts/scrappy-growth|scrappy methods]] like Wizard of Oz tests or manual interventions to validate a feature's value proposition before building it. This approach, such as using a WhatsApp group to manually simulate a subscription service, provides concrete behavioral data at minimal cost.
