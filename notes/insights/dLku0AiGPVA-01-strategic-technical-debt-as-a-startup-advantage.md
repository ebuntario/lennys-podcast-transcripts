As a startup, your job is to take on [[concepts/technical-debt|strategic technical debt]] because that is how you operate faster than a bigger company. This is akin to financial leverage, allowing a small team to build products they otherwise couldn't. However, you must manage a "technical debt runway," as each piece of debt incurs daily "interest" in the form of maintenance time; if you take on too much, you'll spend all your time keeping the lights on instead of building new value.
