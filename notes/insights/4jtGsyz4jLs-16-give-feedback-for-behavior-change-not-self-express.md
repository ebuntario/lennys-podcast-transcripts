Trim 90% of what you want to say in feedback conversations, keeping only what will motivate behavior change. Vent frustrations elsewhere first, then enter the conversation focused on the outcome. This [[concepts/outcome-focus|outcome-oriented approach]] prevents defensive reactions and increases the likelihood of positive change.
