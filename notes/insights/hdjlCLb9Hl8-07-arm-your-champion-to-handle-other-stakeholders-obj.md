In B2B sales with multiple stakeholders, your primary goal is to equip the champion with tools to address others' concerns. While you pitch value to the champion, you must anticipate IT, finance, and end-user objections. Provide the champion with proof points, ROI calculators, and implementation plans to build consensus across the buying committee.
