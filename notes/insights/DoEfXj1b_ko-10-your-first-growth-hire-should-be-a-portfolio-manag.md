For a company's first growth hire focused on acquisition, prioritize a strong first principles thinker over deep channel expertise. This person acts as a "portfolio manager," testing various channels to find the one or two that will drive 80% of signups. Analytical skills and creativity in finding users are more valuable than paid marketing expertise at this stage, which becomes critical later when optimizing for incrementality and scale.
