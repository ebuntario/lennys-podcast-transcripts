Conduct [[concepts/reference-checks]] with former employees not involved in hiring to get honest [[concepts/company-culture]] insights. This [[concepts/candidate-diligence]] mirrors investor practices - you're investing your time, which is more valuable than money. Don't hesitate to ask for manager references at all levels.
