Moving from unstructured intuition ("I know a great PM when I see one") to a structured [[concepts/hiring|hiring]] process with explicit rubrics can drastically improve hit rates. Research shows this can increase successful hires from 50% to 65%. The key is making implicit criteria explicit so they can be examined and refined.
