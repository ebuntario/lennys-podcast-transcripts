To hire a strong leader for a function, identify companies that are best-in-class for that function while serving a similar customer segment (e.g., SMBs, consumers). Don't target the head of that function; instead, recruit their lieutenants or the lieutenants' lieutenants. These individuals have been trained in excellence and are ready for greater scope.
