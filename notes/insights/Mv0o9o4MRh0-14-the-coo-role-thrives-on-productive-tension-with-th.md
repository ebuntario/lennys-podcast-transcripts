A fantastic [[concepts/coo-role|COO]] relationship is not defined by perfect harmony but by the right amount of productive friction and mutual trust. The CEO must trust the COO to execute with high quality, while the COO must feel empowered to push back on priorities and give candid feedback. This dynamic creates a whole greater than the sum of its parts and is a sign the partnership is working.
