A centralized [[concepts/data-org-structure|data org structure]] (center of excellence) is superior to embedding analysts in business units. This model ensures a consistent, high talent bar across the company and provides better growth opportunities for team members, as they can move between different functional areas. It also fosters a strong team culture and allows for consistent methodologies and metrics.
