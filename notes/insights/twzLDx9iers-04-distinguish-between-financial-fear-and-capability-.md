When considering a career leap, differentiate fear of financial instability from fear of personal incapability. Do the math to address specific financial anxiety (e.g., "What monthly burn rate allows me to feel safe?"). Fear of failure or not being good enough, however, is often a flashing green light—it's an invitation to prove your capability and learn, regardless of the outcome.
