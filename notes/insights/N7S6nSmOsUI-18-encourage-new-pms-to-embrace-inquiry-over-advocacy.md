A common trap for new product managers is feeling they need to be the all-knowing expert, which leads to excessive advocacy and working in isolation. Encourage them to embrace a mindset of true curiosity and inquiry. Collaborative, open discovery from the start leads to better solutions and stronger team buy-in than presenting a fully-formed spec developed in a "dark room."
