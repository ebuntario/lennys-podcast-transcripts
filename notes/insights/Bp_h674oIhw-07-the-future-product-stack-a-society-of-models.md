Advanced AI-powered development platforms are built as a [[concepts/multi-agent-systems|society of models]], not a single monolithic AI. Different specialized models handle coding, critiquing, managing, and searching, each optimized for specific tasks within the [[concepts/software-development|software development lifecycle]]. This modular [[concepts/ai-architecture|AI architecture]] combines the strengths of various foundation models and custom-trained components.
