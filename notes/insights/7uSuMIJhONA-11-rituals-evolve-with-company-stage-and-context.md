Effective rituals are not static; they should change as a company grows or enters different modes like "peacetime" versus "wartime." A ritual that works for 100 people may become dysfunctional at 1,000. Leaders must consciously evolve [[concepts/team-rituals|rituals]] to match the current context, and sometimes the act of changing them itself becomes a ritual.
