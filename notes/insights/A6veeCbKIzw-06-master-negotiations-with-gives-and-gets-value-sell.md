Effective [[concepts/negotiation|negotiation]] rests on three pillars: mastering gives and gets (always ask for something in return for a concession), being good at value selling (create needs, affirmation loops, and co-created ROI models), and using the right strategy. A key tactic is to present multiple options (good/better/best or different pricing models) to shift the conversation from price to value.
