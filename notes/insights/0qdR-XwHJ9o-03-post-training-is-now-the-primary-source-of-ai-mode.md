After models ingested the entire internet during pre-training, most improvements now come from the [[concepts/ai-training-data|post-training phase]]. This involves collecting high-quality, domain-specific data to enhance capabilities in areas like coding, mathematics, and reasoning. Labs run experiments like the scientific method, scaling data collection only for hypotheses that show measurable gains in model performance.
