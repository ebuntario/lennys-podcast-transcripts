The most effective growth strategy for transformative products is simply sharing what you've built on social media. When your product demos are inherently impressive and shareable ("holy shit" moments), they generate organic awareness without traditional marketing. This [[concepts/building-in-public|building in public]] approach leverages the product's inherent wow factor to drive word-of-mouth growth.
