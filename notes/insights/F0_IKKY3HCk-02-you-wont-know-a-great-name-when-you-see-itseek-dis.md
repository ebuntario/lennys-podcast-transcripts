Most clients believe they'll recognize a great name instantly, but this almost never happens because humans naturally prefer comfort and familiarity. If your team is completely comfortable with a name, you likely don't have a strong candidate yet. Polarization and tension within a team about a name are signs of strength, indicating the name has energy and distinctiveness.
