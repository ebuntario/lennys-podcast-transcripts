To understand the true incremental value of your ads, use the Conversion Lift or GeoX tests offered by platforms like Google and Meta. These tests intentionally withhold ads from a control group. While these tests require significant spend (e.g., >$50K/month) to be statistically valid, they provide the clearest picture of what would have happened without your ads.
