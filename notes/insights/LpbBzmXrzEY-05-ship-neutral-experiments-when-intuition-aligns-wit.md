When an experiment shows neutral results but aligns with strong product intuition about what helps users succeed, consider shipping it anyway. The default (control) isn't necessarily better just because it's existing, and neutral changes that improve the user experience can reveal long-term benefits that short-term metrics miss. This approach balances [[concepts/data-driven-decisions|data-driven decisions]] with principled product judgment.
