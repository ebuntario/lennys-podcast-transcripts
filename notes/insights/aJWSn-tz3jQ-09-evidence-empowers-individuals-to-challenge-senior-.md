In an evidence-guided culture, data and test results become a powerful tool for anyone in the organization to engage in constructive debate with leadership. Instead of a battle of opinions where the highest-paid person's view often wins, presenting hard evidence from experiments or user research creates a more objective and nuanced discussion. This can lead to better decisions and helps avoid large-scale strategic missteps.
