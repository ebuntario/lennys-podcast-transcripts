While data from funnels and experiments is valuable, it often misses orthogonal problems that only [[concepts/user-research|direct observation]] can uncover. Watching a user struggle in real-time—like entering a formal name nobody recognizes—reveals friction points that analytics might attribute to later steps in the funnel. Combining data with empathetic observation provides a complete picture of user barriers.
