Programming languages like Python and JavaScript can be treated as structured data for [[concepts/large-language-models|large language models]]. Their constrained semantics compared to natural language make them particularly suitable for tasks like code translation and multi-line prediction. This insight shifts the focus from models that understand only human language to models that understand the language of creation.
