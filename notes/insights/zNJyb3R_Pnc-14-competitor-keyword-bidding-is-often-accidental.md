If a competitor is bidding on your brand keywords, don't assume malicious intent. It's often due to poor account management or Google's close variant matching. Use tools like Auction Insights reports to distinguish consistent conquesting from one-off errors before reacting. For trademark violations in ad copy, you can file a claim with the platform.
