Avoid making promises about stability, titles, or long-term roles during hiring or management conversations, as these are often outside your control in a scaling company. Such promises are "letter bombs" that explode later, demoralizing high performers when broken. Instead, be honest about the inherent ambiguity and change, which attracts people comfortable with that environment and builds trust through transparency.
