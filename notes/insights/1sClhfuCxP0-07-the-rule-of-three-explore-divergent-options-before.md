Before settling on a plan, force teams to develop **three fully-formed, divergent options** (e.g., three different PR/FAQs). This [[concepts/ideation|ideation]] discipline ensures thorough exploration, allows stakeholders to see their ideas considered, and provides a clear basis for comparison. It transforms [[concepts/decision-making|decision-making]] from a debate over one idea into a structured choice between concrete alternatives.
