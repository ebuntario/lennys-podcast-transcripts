The Model Context Protocol (MCP) solves the middle layer of AI utility by providing standardized access to context and memory across systems. When all product primitives are exposed via MCP, AI agents can read from and write to them seamlessly. This transforms every feature into a [[concepts/ai-agents|scriptable, composable component]] that models can use agentically, moving beyond simple computer use to true system integration.
