The most surprising and impactful use of AI at Block is by non-technical teams building their own software tools. For example, the enterprise risk management team built a self-service system, compressing weeks of work into hours. This blurs the lines between roles and allows teams to optimize their specific workflows without waiting for engineering resources, demonstrating significant [[concepts/cross-functional-productivity|cross-functional productivity]] gains.
