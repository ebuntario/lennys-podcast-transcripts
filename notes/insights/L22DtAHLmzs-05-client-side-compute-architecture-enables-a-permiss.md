Building a core technology that runs compute directly in the user's browser (like WebContainer) unlocks a fundamentally different [[concepts/software-architecture|scalability model]]. It removes server costs for basic operations, eliminates latency, and allows for a truly permissive [[concepts/free-tier|free tier]] since abuse doesn't incur cloud expenses. This architectural bet can become a massive competitive moat for products requiring heavy, interactive computation.
