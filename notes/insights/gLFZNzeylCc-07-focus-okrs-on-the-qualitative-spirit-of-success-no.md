The primary goal of [[concepts/okrs|OKRs]] should be to get crisp on what qualitative success looks like—what would make you say you "crushed it" for users and the business. It's better to have ambitious, missed OKRs where the team learned why, than to have all-green OKRs that were sandbagged and didn't move the needle. This prevents teams from optimizing for metric success over delivering real value.
