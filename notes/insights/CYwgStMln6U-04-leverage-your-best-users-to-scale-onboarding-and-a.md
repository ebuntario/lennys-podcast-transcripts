A powerful [[concepts/growth-levers|growth lever]] is turning your best existing users into mentors or recruiters for new users. Lyft paid top drivers to onboard new drivers, which was cheaper, faster, and provided authentic social proof and tips that official marketing couldn't match. This approach also increased retention and recognition for the mentors, creating a scalable [[concepts/community-building|community-powered]] engine.
