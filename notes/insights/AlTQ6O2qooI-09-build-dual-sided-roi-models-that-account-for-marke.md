Effective customer acquisition in a marketplace requires a dual-sided ROI model. For example, the CAC for a rider must include the cost to acquire the necessary drivers (based on the rider-to-driver ratio). This model fully internalizes the [[concepts/marketplace-strategy|marketplace dynamic]], allowing you to push acquisition on both sides to your target payback period while largely ignoring simplistic balance metrics.
