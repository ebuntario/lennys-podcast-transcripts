While cultural differences exist, over-customizing for each international market adds complexity that slows iteration and increases maintenance costs. For consumer apps, core human behaviors are often similar across markets, so focus on the 80% universal needs first. Only customize when absolutely necessary (like regulatory requirements) to maintain [[concepts/scaling-strategy|scaling]] velocity and simplicity.
