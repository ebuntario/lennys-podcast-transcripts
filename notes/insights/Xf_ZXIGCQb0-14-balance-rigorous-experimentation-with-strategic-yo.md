While rigorous [[concepts/testing|experimentation]] is a growth cornerstone, it can sometimes be slow. Introduce strategic "YOLO" launches for changes where the team has high confidence in a better user experience or positive outcome. You can launch many small changes quickly and use holdouts or pre-post analysis to guard against major regressions, often achieving faster learning and impact than full experiments.
