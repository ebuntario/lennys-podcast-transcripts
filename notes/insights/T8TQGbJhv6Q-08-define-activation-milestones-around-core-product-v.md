Identify your product's core "aha" journey and set increasing thresholds of activation. For Calendly, it's creating a first meeting, then creating five in a week. For Typeform, it's publishing a form and viewing responses. For Twitter, it's constructing a follow graph (following or being followed), which builds the informal community central to the experience. Track drop-off between these thresholds to improve activation.
