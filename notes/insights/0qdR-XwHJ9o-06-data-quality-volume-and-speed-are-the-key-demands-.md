AI labs prioritize three factors when sourcing training data: quality (incorrect data harms models), volume (thousands of data points in niche domains), and speed (rapid iteration on hypotheses). Suppliers must deliver high-quality data at scale within days to support the labs' experimental pipelines, where researchers quickly double down on what works and abandon what doesn't.
