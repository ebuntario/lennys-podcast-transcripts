A GIST board (Goals, Ideas, Steps, Tasks) helps teams manage the middle layer between high-level strategy and daily tasks. It displays the team's key results, the ideas being tested to achieve them, and the validation steps (like usability tests or prototypes) planned. This makes the [[concepts/discovery-delivery|discovery process]] visible and dynamic, shifting focus from simply completing tasks to achieving learning milestones.
