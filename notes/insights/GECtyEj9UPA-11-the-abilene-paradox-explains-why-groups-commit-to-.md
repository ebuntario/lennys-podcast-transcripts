The Abilene paradox occurs when everyone in a group privately believes an idea is bad but goes along with it because they assume everyone else is on board. This leads to collective action on poor decisions. Recognizing this dynamic is the first step to preventing it, requiring a habitat where people feel safe to voice dissent early, thereby improving [[concepts/group-dynamics|group dynamics]] and decision quality.
