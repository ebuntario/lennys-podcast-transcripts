Before committing to an outcome-based goal, diagnose where your team is relative to the "frontier of understanding." The four risk areas are: 1) Understanding Risk (don't know the levers), 2) Dependency Risk (lack tools/resources), 3) Execution Risk (can't implement), and 4) Strategic Risk (hypothesis might be wrong). The appropriate goal type (learning, execution, or outcome) depends on which risk is most present.
