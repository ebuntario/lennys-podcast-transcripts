Blindly copying competitor flows or tactics fails 95% of the time because each experience is tailored to specific customers and channels. Use [[concepts/competitor-analysis|competitor analysis]] for inspiration and pattern recognition, but never skip [[concepts/ideation|ideation]], user research, and experimentation. Innovation requires adapting insights to your unique context rather than replicating others' solutions.
