A key function of [[concepts/product-operations|product operations]] is managing the [[concepts/customer-feedback|voice of customer]] by aggregating and synthesizing inputs from multiple sources like sales, support, and product usage data. This process creates transparency across revenue teams and helps product managers prioritize based on validated customer needs rather than isolated departmental requests. The synthesis reveals patterns that individual teams might miss when operating in silos.
