The current underappreciated limiting factor for [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agent]] productivity is human typing speed and multitasking speed for reviewing and validating work. Even if an agent can generate output, the human is still bottlenecked on reviewing all that code or output. The key unlock is rebuilding systems to allow the agent to be useful by default and to validate its own work, freeing the human from this manual loop.
