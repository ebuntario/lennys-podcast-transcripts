Distributing marketing functions throughout the organization—with growth marketing in growth teams, brand marketing with communications leaders, and product marketing with product teams—keeps specialists close to their primary outcomes. This structure reduces coordination overhead and increases execution speed, but requires strong central vision holders to maintain brand cohesion. The approach works best when founders or executives provide clear brand direction.
