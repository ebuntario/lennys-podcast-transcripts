Recruiters look for two key signals: a candidate's intent/interest in a role and validated proof of their skills. To improve visibility, job seekers should use features like "Open to Work," follow or signal interest in target companies, and, crucially, attach credentials and work samples to the [[concepts/skills-first-hiring|skills listed on their profile]]. This provides concrete evidence beyond job titles.
