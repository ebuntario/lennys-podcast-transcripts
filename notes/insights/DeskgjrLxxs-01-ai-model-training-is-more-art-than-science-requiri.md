Model training involves balancing competing objectives, similar to [[concepts/debugging|debugging software]]. For example, teaching a model it lacks a physical body while also training it on function calls like "set an alarm" can create confusion, forcing a trade-off between helpfulness and safety. The process focuses on making models robust across diverse scenarios through careful data curation.
