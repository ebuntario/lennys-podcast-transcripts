Putting forward a strong opinion, even if it's wrong, is better than offering nothing because people are more likely to react to an idea. This catalyzes discussion and leads to a more opinionated and refined solution. However, maintain "strong opinions, weakly held" and be ready to pivot or "kill your darlings" when presented with compelling external signal.
