Your energy often comes more from the customer segment you serve than the specific problem you're solving. Identify whether you get more motivation from helping consumers, small businesses, or large enterprises. Aligning your work with the customers you relate to personally leads to greater satisfaction and impact, as you can directly see and feel the results of your efforts.
