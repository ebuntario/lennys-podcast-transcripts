The most effective way for an [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agent]] to use a computer and affect the world is by writing code. Code is composable and interoperable, allowing agents to build scripts for any task. Therefore, a viable [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]] for creating a general-purpose assistant is to first build a superior coding agent. To the end-user, this competency becomes an invisible, powerful primitive enabling a wide range of tasks.
