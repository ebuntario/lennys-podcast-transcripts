Effective [[concepts/product-operations|product operations]] involves standing up necessary processes and systems, then finding ways to automate or delegate them to focus on higher-value work.

This mindset embraces change and recognizes that human effort should be directed toward problems that truly require strategic thinking rather than administrative maintenance.
