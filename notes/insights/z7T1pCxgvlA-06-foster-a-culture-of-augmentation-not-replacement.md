To build successful AI products, cultivate a culture where AI is seen as augmenting and 10Xing human capability, not replacing jobs. This is critical for gaining buy-in from subject matter experts whose deep domain knowledge is essential for training and evaluating AI systems. An empowering culture turns the entire organization into collaborators in the AI transformation.
