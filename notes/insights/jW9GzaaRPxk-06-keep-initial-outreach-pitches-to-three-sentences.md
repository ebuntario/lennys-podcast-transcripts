The most successful [[concepts/pitching|pitches]] are extremely concise—often just three sentences. Clearly state your intention (e.g., offering an exclusive launch story) and the key details. Long, convoluted emails are less effective due to short attention spans. You can provide more context if the reporter expresses interest.
