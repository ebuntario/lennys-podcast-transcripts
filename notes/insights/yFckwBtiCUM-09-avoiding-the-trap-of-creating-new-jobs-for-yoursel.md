When building an independent path, be vigilant about not creating new "jobs" for yourself that you don't enjoy. Protect your creative energy by outsourcing, automating, or eliminating tasks that drain you, even if they seem like logical growth opportunities. The goal is to design a work life centered on activities that bring you alive, not to replicate the burdens of traditional employment.
