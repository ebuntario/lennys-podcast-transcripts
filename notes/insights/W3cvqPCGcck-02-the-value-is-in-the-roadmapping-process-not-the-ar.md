The real value of a roadmap isn't the static document or chart you create. Similar to how the value of a design prototype is in the [[concepts/feedback-loops|feedback and iteration]] it generates, the value of roadmapping is in the collaborative process of discussing priorities and assumptions. The artifact itself is disposable and should be continuously updated as you learn.
