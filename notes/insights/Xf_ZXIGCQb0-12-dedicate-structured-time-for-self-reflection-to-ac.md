A key to sustained success is the disciplined practice of [[concepts/self-awareness|self-reflection]]. Carve out dedicated time (e.g., an hour in a morning routine) to systematically review what's working and what's not across all life domains—career, health, family. Use a simple dashboard to track experiments and progress, and actively seek feedback, even from personal relationships, to identify areas for improvement.
