For developer tools, a proven playbook for early growth is deep, direct engagement with a specific, growing community. Snyk's founders focused on the Node.js community, presenting at conferences and meetups, building online content, and posing the hook question: "Do you have known vulnerabilities in your apps?" This community-focused, depth-first approach allowed them to meaningfully influence a group that was small enough to impact but large enough to represent a real opportunity, driving initial user acquisition.
