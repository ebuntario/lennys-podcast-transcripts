Instead of trying to create a new software category, focus on elevating a profession. People fight for a job identity, not a budget line item. By building community and importance around a role (like Gainsight did for customer success), you embed your product into that identity. This [[concepts/positioning|positioning]] is more powerful and defensible than generic category creation.
