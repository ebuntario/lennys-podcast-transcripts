Revolut's recruitment team uses a sprint-based approach where they identify [[concepts/product-excellence|products and apps they admire]] and target those companies for sourcing candidates. This method increases the likelihood of finding high performers who have demonstrated ability to build great products, regardless of their specific industry background.
