Networks built at large companies often consist of specialists who prefer that environment, which may not translate to an early-stage startup network. To prepare for founding a company, proactively build connections within early-stage communities like indie hackers or Everything Marketplaces. These networks include generalist builders, freelancers, and investors who are passionate about the unique challenges of the startup stage.
