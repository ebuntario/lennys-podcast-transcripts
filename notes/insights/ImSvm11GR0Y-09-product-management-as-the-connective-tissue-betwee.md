Rather than viewing product management as a standalone function, see it as the discipline that connects and collaborates with data, design, technology, and strategy domains. The PM's unique value comes from having insight across all these areas and synthesizing them toward product goals. This [[concepts/cross-functional-collaboration|collaborative role]] should increase the team's overall energy and output, not just manage individual contributions.
