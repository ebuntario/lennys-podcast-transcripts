The Atlassian model involved waiting a long time to hire salespeople, instead reinvesting that budget into engineering to create a product that could sell itself. When sales is introduced, it should focus on engaging accounts that have already shown strong product-led signals, such as a high number of users already paying. This intent-based approach ensures salespeople work with prospects who are already likely to buy, maximizing efficiency.
