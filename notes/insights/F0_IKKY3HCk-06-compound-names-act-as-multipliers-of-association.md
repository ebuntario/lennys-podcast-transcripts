Compound names like Powerbook, Facebook, or Windsurf create a multiplier effect where each component word carries its own associations, combining to form a richer mental image than a single word. This makes compounds particularly effective for creating distinctive, memorable names that fire the imagination and are easier for the brain to process than invented words.
