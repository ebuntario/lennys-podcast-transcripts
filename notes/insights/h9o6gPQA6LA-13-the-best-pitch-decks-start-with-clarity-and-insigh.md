Avoid "Franken-decks" that try to answer every possible objection. An effective early-stage [[concepts/pitch-decks|pitch deck]] has three core slides: 1) What you do (stated simply, as if the listener knows nothing). 2) Your non-obvious insight (the thing you know that others don't—agree on this or nothing else matters). 3) Proof points (any evidence that supports your insight). This [[concepts/narrative|storytelling]] approach focuses on believers and makes your core argument unmistakable.
