A depth-first approach is critical for validating a solution on the path to [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]]. Snyk started by focusing on a single persona (Node.js developers), a single context (open source dependencies), and a single use case (finding vulnerabilities), which was narrow enough to build a compelling solution quickly but wide enough for viable growth. This allowed them to nail the initial use case for a specific community before expanding wider, which is generally sound advice for building solid momentum before casting a larger net.
