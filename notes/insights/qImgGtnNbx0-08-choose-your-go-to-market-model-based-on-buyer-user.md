Select a [[concepts/go-to-market-strategy|go-to-market model]] through first-principles analysis of your customer's purchasing process. Developer-led growth works when the user (an engineer) is the buyer. Product-led growth (PLG) works when the user and buyer are the same person, as in small business software. Direct sales is necessary when the buyer (e.g., a finance department) is different from the end-user (e.g., an employee), a common scenario in enterprise AI and agent software.
