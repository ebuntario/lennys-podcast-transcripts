Modern consumers are **lazy** (they won't invest time), **vain** (they have entrenched habits), and **selfish** (they demand clear value). Successful [[concepts/onboarding|user onboarding]] must shatter these barriers by continuing the marketing promise seamlessly into the first product experience. This requires deep [[concepts/behavioral-economics|empathy]] and a ruthless focus on a single, clear [[concepts/product-positioning|value proposition]] rather than overwhelming users with all features at once.
