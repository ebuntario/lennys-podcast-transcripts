A "golden gut" in product thinking is the instinct for making micro-decisions that reduce [[concepts/cognitive-load|cognitive load]] and simplify user experience. It's developed through experience and involves ruthless reductionism, such as using presumptuous defaults instead of multiple steps. This intuition helps trade off minor confusion for a subset of users against major speed gains for the majority, leading to better overall outcomes.
