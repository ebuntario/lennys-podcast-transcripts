Driving is a social activity governed by unspoken norms that vary by location. An autonomous system cannot rely solely on explicit traffic rules; it must also learn and adapt to local social norms, like when it's acceptable for pedestrians to cross against a light. Incorporating this understanding is key to creating natural and context-aware driving behavior.
