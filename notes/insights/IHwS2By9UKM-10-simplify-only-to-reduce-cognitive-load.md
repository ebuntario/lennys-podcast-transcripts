Simplifying onboarding or flows should address specific [[concepts/cognitive-friction|cognitive friction]] problems, not be a generic goal. Removing steps indiscriminately can strip away product identity and value; focus on clarifying confusing elements instead. Avoid roadmap items like "simplify onboarding" without defining the user confusion you're solving.
