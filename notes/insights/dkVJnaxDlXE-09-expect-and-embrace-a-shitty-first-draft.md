The first complete draft of a narrative will be wrong and will involve discarding many good ideas from the team to achieve clarity. This creates a predictable "low point" in the development process. However, having a concrete, flawed draft is far more valuable than a collection of ideas because it gives the team a specific target for [[concepts/feedback|feedback]] and rapid [[concepts/iteration|iteration]].
