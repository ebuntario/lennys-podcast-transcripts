Large language models can improve fastest in domains like [[concepts/software-engineering|software engineering]] because the output is deterministic—code either runs or it doesn't. This allows for massive-scale reinforcement learning by automatically generating and testing thousands of code permutations. This technical reality suggests coding is a vertical where AI capabilities will accelerate far more quickly than in non-deterministic fields like law or creative writing.
