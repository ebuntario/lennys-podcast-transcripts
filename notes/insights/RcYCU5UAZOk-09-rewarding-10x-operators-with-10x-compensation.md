Design compensation systems to reward top performers disproportionately. Small teams of exceptional people drive far more impact than larger mediocre teams. Companies should think about how to differentially hire, retain, and accelerate high performers by rewarding them significantly more. This requires a mindset shift from focusing solely on compensation bands and equality to enabling [[concepts/performance-management|performance-based differentiation]] at all levels.
