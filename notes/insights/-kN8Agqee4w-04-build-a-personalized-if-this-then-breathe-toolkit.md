Create a set of breath practices for different contexts. For example: if overwhelmed, do humming; if anxious, do 4-4-8 breathing; if lethargic, do "espresso breath." Practice them daily for 5 minutes to build the muscle memory, so you remember to use them in high-stress moments when you need them most.
