When non-engineers can produce working [[concepts/prototyping|prototypes]], it creates a concrete, shared language that bridges the silos between design, product, and engineering. Instead of relying on low-bandwidth text descriptions or static mocks, teams can communicate with functional code, reducing misinterpretation. This fosters more fluid [[concepts/cross-functional-collaboration|cross-functional collaboration]] and a culture where roles are less rigidly defined.
