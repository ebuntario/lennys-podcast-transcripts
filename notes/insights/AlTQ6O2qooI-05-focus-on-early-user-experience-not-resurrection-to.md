The most effective way to improve [[concepts/retention|retention]] is by perfecting the early user experience to prove value, not by trying to resurrect churned users. Companies like Uber and Lyft guarantee high first-week earnings to homogenize and prove a positive experience. In contrast, resurrection efforts target users who have already decided the product isn't for them, making it a lower-leverage activity.
