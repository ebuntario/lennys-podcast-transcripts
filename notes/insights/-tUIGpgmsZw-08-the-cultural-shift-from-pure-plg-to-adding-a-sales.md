Transitioning from a pure [[concepts/product-led-growth|product-led growth (PLG)]] model to adding a sales-led motion requires significant cultural and operational changes across people, process, and product. The sales profile shifts from inbound-focused "growers" to outbound "hunters," and the target buyer changes from individual department heads to potentially IT and CIOs. This shift demands highly integrated processes versus the more siloed approach that can work in a self-service PLG model.
