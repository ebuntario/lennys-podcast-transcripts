A common pitfall is assuming your existing [[concepts/segmentation|customer base]] will adopt a new product using the same playbook. Before building, test your distribution hypothesis with lightweight methods like waitlist sign-ups or ads in existing customer communications. This prevents investing heavily in a solution for a segment that may have fundamentally different needs or adoption patterns.
