Three key results typically work best—one hard metric, one qualitative measure (like customer satisfaction), and one business outcome (often revenue-related). This triangulation ensures teams don't optimize for one dimension at the expense of others. Brainstorming multiple measurement approaches before selecting key results often reveals better [[concepts/metrics-selection|metrics selection]] than settling for the most obvious choices.
