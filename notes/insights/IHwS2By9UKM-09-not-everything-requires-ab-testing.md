Testing every change creates [[concepts/experimentation-paralysis|experimentation paralysis]]; reserve A/B tests for high-stakes decisions or high-traffic areas where small lifts matter. For low-volume initiatives, use [[concepts/pre-post-analysis|pre-post analysis]] and trust [[concepts/intuition-in-decision-making|intuition]] informed by user understanding. Move fast, measure later, and roll back if needed.
