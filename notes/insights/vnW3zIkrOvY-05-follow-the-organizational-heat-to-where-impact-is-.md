In a scaling startup, the "heat"—or the area needing the most help—shifts between functions. It moves from product/idea validation to engineering/build, then to sales, and finally to marketing/brand. High-impact individuals naturally gravitate toward and are placed in these areas of greatest need to unblock the company's next growth phase.
