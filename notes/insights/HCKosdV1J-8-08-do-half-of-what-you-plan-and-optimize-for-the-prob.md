When building an [[concepts/minimum-viable-product|MVP]], only include features that prevent users from getting to the point where they can ask for more. Optimize for the problems you *want* to have, like users requesting new platforms or capabilities. A key principle is to do half the features you plan, offer half the options, and focus on half the market, as reduction often increases core metric velocity by removing distraction.
