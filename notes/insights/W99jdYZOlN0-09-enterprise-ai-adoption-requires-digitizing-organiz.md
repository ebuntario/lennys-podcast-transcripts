While off-the-shelf AI models combined with RAG and fine-tuning provide initial value, enterprises hit limits when they need to capture organization-specific judgment.

Breaking through this bottleneck requires having internal experts label data that represents how their organization makes decisions, creating evaluation benchmarks that define "what good looks like" in their specific context.
