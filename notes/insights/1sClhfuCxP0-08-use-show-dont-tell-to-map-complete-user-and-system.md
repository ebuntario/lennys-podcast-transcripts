Move beyond abstract personas to concrete "show, don't tell" journeys. Map out a specific person's entire interaction, from the external trigger to every screen and emotional state, especially in real-time systems like marketplaces. Visualizing these complete [[concepts/user-research|user and system journeys]] creates a shared artifact that aligns teams, exposes hidden complexities, and ensures every pixel serves the user's goal.
