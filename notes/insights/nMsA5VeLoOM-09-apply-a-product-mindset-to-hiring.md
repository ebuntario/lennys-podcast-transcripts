Treat hiring like a product development cycle with marketing, sales, and product components. Build a positive employer brand (marketing), understand the candidate's motivations (sales), and iteratively craft the role based on candidate strengths and business needs (product). This approach moves beyond filling headcount to building a team designed for success.
