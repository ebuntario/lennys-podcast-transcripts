Hiring a [[concepts/growth-team|growth team]] too early is a common mistake; growth should be founder-led until strong [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]] and sufficient user data exist. Founders must first discover how to grow to at least $1-10M ARR themselves, as outsourcing this core discovery rarely works. Growth teams optimize and scale existing traction—they don't create it from scratch.
