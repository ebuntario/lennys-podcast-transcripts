Building natural [[concepts/multimodal-ai|voice AI]] involves complex [[concepts/system-design|system design]] challenges beyond text models, such as managing latency across voice-to-text and text-to-voice hops, and detecting user interruptions to enable fluid conversation. These are often classical engineering or ML problems, not just foundation model issues.
