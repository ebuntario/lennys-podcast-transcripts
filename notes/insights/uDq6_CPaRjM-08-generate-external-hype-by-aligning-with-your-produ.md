External hype is driven by making users feel special and connected to your product's personality. For FigJam's anniversary, they created an in-product Easter egg hunt with "presents" (new features) to match its cheeky, fun brand. Hype should feel authentic to the product—whether it's a niche capability for pros or a delightful unboxing experience—to form a genuine emotional connection with users.
