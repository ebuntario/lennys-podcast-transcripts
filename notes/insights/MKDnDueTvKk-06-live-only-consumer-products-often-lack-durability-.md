A generalized, live-only consumer product (like early Periscope) often struggles with retention because users have no reason to engage between live sessions. Durability usually requires embedding the live capability within a broader [[concepts/asynchronous-scaffolding|asynchronous scaffolding]] that lets a community interact continuously. This is why live features succeed within larger platforms like Instagram or TikTok.
