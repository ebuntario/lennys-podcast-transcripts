A small team where key members have worked together for five-plus years creates an environment of high trust and shared context. This is a massive advantage during [[concepts/hypergrowth|hypergrowth]], as everyone can make independent decisions with minimal communication overhead. Daily full-team syncs can further reduce information loss, ensuring alignment and enabling rapid, autonomous execution without bureaucratic approval layers.
