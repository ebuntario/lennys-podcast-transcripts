Decouple engineering delivery from major marketing campaigns by implementing a [[concepts/soft-launch|soft launch]] first. This allows development to release when ready, giving marketing a working product to base their campaigns on, gather early testimonials, and create authentic content. The subsequent "hard launch" can then be planned with confidence, based on real user feedback and a stable product.
