Current AI excels at language but lacks the [[concepts/spatial-intelligence|3D understanding]] necessary for physical interaction and reasoning in the world. This capability is crucial for [[concepts/embodied-ai|robotics]] and for augmenting human tasks that require spatial reasoning, such as design or scientific discovery. Developing [[concepts/world-models|generative models of 3D worlds]] addresses this gap by enabling creation, interaction, and reasoning within spatial environments.
