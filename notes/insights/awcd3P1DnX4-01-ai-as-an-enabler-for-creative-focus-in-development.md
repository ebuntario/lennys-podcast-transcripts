AI tools like [[concepts/ai-pair-programmer|AI pair programmers]] are designed to handle the laborious aspects of coding, such as syntax recall and boilerplate generation. This allows developers to stay in a state of creative flow and focus on higher-level design and problem-solving. The goal is to augment human creativity rather than replace the developer's critical thinking role.
