Entrepreneurship often requires periods where you must make judgment calls that go against the [[concepts/conviction|consensus view]], especially when pursuing long-term technology plays. This requires the confidence to ignore prevailing advice (like "don't build tech looking for a problem") and maintain extreme capital efficiency, trusting that the market will eventually align with your vision years later.
