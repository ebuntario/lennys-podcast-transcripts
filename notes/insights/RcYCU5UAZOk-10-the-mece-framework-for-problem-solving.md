Apply the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) framework when tackling problems. Break down an issue into components that don't overlap and cover all possibilities. For example, if revenue growth slows, decompose it into revenue per user and number of users, then further break those down. This [[concepts/strategy|structured approach]] ensures comprehensive solution development and builds confidence that you haven't missed a key lever.
