The threshold of [[concepts/customer-desperation|customer desperation]] is critically underestimated. Startups should solve problems for people who are irresistibly drawn to the new empowerment, to the point where they'll tolerate early-stage flaws. If a customer has other good alternatives, they won't take a risk on a startup. Therefore, target [[concepts/early-adopters|early adopters]] who are desperate for your unique difference, not a broad market with mild interest.
