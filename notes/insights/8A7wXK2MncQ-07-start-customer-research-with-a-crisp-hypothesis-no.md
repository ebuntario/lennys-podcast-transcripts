Before talking to customers, articulate a clear hypothesis about what you think they will say or what pain point they experience. This provides a framework to validate or invalidate, rather than collecting disjointed anecdotes. However, avoid falling in love with your hypothesis; act as a judge, not a lawyer, and be open to the evidence disproving it.
