The [[concepts/product-development|Double Diamond process]] involves two phases of broadening and narrowing: first on the target customer and problem, then on the solution. This forces teams to move from opinion-driven debates to being curious and systematic, ensuring decisions are grounded in customer insight. Mapping key product reviews (like kickoffs, concept reviews, and specs) to these inflection points creates a rigorous, customer-centric development rhythm.
