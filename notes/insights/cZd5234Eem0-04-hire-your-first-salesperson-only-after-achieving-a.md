Founders should hire their first salesperson only after they can reliably close deals themselves at a statistically significant win rate (e.g., 15-25% over 50-100 attempts). This proves you have a [[concepts/repeatable-process|repeatable process]] to package and teach. Hiring before this point is like deploying software that only runs on your local machine.
