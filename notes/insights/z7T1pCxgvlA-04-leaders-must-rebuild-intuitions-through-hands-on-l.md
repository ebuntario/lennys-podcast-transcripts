Successful AI adoption requires leaders to be vulnerable and rebuild their intuitions from the ground up. This means dedicating time to be hands-on—whether through coding sessions or consuming expert content—to understand the technology's capabilities and limitations. Leaders must accept that their past intuitions may not apply and be willing to learn from everyone on the team.
