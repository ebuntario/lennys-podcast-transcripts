While chat is a good universal interface for an AI assistant when you don't know what to ask for, the future is mixed-initiative and contextual. The agent should understand what you're attempting to do and surface helpful actions at the right moment, keeping you in flow. This requires moving beyond a pure chat interface to build [[concepts/user-experience|UX]] where the agent can proactively help based on context, similar to contextual actions in video games or previews in a coding environment.
