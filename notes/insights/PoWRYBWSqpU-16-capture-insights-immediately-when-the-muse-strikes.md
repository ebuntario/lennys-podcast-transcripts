When an interesting idea or formulation strikes, capture it immediately in a rough note, as the "first act of creation" is the hardest. This practice of [[concepts/insight-capture|insight capture]] prevents the loss of fleeting thoughts that are difficult to reconstruct later. Regular [[concepts/reflection-practice|reflection practice]] to refine these notes is where deeper patterns and true [[concepts/creativity|creativity]] emerge.
