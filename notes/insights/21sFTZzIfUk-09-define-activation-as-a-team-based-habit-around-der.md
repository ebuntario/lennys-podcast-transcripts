[[concepts/activation-metrics|Activation]] should be defined as a team forming a habit around deriving the product's core value, not just individual user actions. For Snyk, activation is a team fixing a vulnerability within 30 days of creation, which strongly correlates with three-month retention. This team-based view is important because security is a "team sport," and different people may fulfill different parts of the journey. The specific habit moment should be identified through quantitative analysis (e.g., using ML models) to find the behavior that most strongly correlates with long-term retention.
