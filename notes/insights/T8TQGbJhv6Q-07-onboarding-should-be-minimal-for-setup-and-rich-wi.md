Effective [[concepts/user-onboarding|onboarding]] has two parts: a mandatory, sparse setup (ideally no more than three screens) covering only the essentials for success, and a rich set of optional, random-access guidance for curious users. For example, Calendly's mandatory setup only asks users to connect their calendar and set availability defaults. Overly long wizards often hurt more than they help.
