The "work alone together" method involves team members thinking and writing individually in silence before sharing and discussing. This technique generates deeper, more diverse ideas than traditional group brainstorms and ensures quieter voices are heard. It combines the benefits of [[concepts/idea-generation|individual deep thinking]] with the alignment of collaborative synthesis, leading to higher-quality outputs.
