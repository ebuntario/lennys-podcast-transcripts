When evaluating founders, value those who are optimistic about the future but pragmatic and somewhat pessimistic about the present. They openly discuss obstacles and what keeps them up at night. On the product side, look for a clean "object model"—a clear structure where users always know how they got somewhere, what to do now, and what to do next. This indicates a team that values intuitive user experience.
