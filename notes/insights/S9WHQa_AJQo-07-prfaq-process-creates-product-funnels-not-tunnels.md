The [[concepts/pr-faq-process|PR/FAQ process]] involves writing hypothetical press releases to crystallize customer problems and solutions. This creates a product funnel where many ideas enter but few progress, unlike product tunnels where everything gets built. The concentric circle review process allows ideas to be refined or discarded early based on customer value rather than implementation momentum.
