The practical and commercially viable goal for autonomous vehicles is Level 4 autonomy (fully driverless within a defined operational domain), not Level 5 (driverless anywhere under any condition). Level 4 solves the vast majority of valuable use cases, like ride-hailing in mapped cities, and is a more achievable and transformative milestone than the unbounded challenge of Level 5.
