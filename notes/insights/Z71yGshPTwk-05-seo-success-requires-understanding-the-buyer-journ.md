Successful SEO focuses on where users are in their [[concepts/user-journey|buyer journey]] rather than chasing top rankings for broad keywords. Measure SEO success by business outcomes like MQLs, sales, or product usage—not just traffic or rankings. Content should guide users toward conversion points rather than stopping at information delivery.
