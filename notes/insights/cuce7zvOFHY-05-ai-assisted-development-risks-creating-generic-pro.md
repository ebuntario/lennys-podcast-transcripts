The ease of AI-generated prototyping can lead to products that are generic because they are trained on existing data and patterns. To avoid this, teams must first do the hard thinking about what makes their solution unique before leveraging [[concepts/ai-development|AI tools]] for execution. Outsourcing prototyping is efficient, but outsourcing the core strategic thinking undermines differentiation.
