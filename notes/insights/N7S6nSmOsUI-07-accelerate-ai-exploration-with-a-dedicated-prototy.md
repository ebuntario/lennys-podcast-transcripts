For fast-moving technologies like LLMs, create a small, dedicated team tasked with rapid prototyping outside the normal product process. This team can bypass typical discovery phases to quickly test what's possible, separating hype from reality. Once promising prototypes are identified, hand them off to the domain teams with the deepest customer knowledge to own and scale, effectively distributing new [[concepts/innovation|innovation]] capabilities.
