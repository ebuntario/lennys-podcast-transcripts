In business, many people avoid [[concepts/narrative|storytelling]] because they fear standing out from the herd, but the alternative is being forgettable. Our minds are not designed to remember facts, statistics, or platitudes that aren't attached to imagery. If you don't tell stories, you risk being completely forgotten by your audience.
