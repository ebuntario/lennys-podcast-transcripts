Bootstrapping is ideal for building cash-flowing, lifestyle businesses, while venture funding is the path for companies aiming to reach a billion dollars in annual revenue. A common mistake is misaligning funding strategy with ambition; for instance, bootstrapping a venture-scale idea can limit growth potential, just as raising VC for a non-scalable idea creates unnecessary pressure. Founders should honestly assess their target market size and desired outcome.
