A [[concepts/jobcation|jobcation]] is a less demanding role taken intentionally to rest, recover, and reset after an intense period like a startup. It allows you to rebuild personal relationships and rediscover your core identity outside a high-pressure context. The goal is to regain the mental and physical capacity to make a clear-headed next career move.
