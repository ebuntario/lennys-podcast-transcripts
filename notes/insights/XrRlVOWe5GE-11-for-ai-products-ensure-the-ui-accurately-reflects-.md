A critical principle for AI/ML products is that "the promise of the UI has to match the quality of the underlying data." Current LLMs often fail by presenting hallucinations with supreme confidence, which erodes user trust. Design systems that acknowledge uncertainty, cite sources, and are transparent about limitations. Building [[concepts/user-trust|trust]] requires the interface to communicate the system's actual reliability, not an idealized version of it.
