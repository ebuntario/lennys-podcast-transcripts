The most impactful shift in product development is to minimize time spent debating static design mocks. Instead, prioritize getting into a live, interactive prototype—even a messy one—as quickly as possible. How software *feels* in use is fundamentally different from how it looks in a mockup. This approach resolves design debates faster and surfaces real usability issues earlier in the [[concepts/product-innovation|iteration cycle]].
