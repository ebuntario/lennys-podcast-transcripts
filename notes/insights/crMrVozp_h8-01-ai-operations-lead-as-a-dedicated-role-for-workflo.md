Having a dedicated [[concepts/ai-operations|AI operations lead]] is a major unlock for organizations. This person identifies repetitive tasks across the company and builds prompts and workflows to automate them, freeing other employees from having to context-switch into building automations themselves. This role is most effective when the person has a process-oriented mindset, understands the craft they're automating, and is excited about tinkering with AI tools.
