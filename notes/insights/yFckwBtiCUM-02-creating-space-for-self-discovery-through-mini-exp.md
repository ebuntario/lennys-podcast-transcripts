Start with small, low-risk experiments to reconnect with yourself and question your relationship to work. Block off three hours during a workday to do something from your childhood or go for a walk without a destination, then practice [[concepts/work-mindfulness|work mindfulness]] by noticing what emotions and thoughts emerge. This creates space to ask foundational questions like "Why do I work?" beyond just money, revealing internalized scripts about being a "good person."
