The traditional "arrogant doctor" pitch (problem → solution → why better) sets you up for bragging and comparisons. Instead, frame your offering around a [[concepts/strategic-narrative|strategic narrative]] that describes a fundamental shift in the world, inviting prospects to join a movement. This approach, exemplified by Salesforce's "software to cloud" story, creates a more compelling and unifying message than simply solving a discrete problem.
