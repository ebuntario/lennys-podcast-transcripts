The core job of [[concepts/growth-mindset|growth]] is to connect users to the value of your product, not just to hack metrics. This requires thinking about the user holistically across their entire journey, as the value a user seeks can change over time. A healthy, durable company focuses on this connection rather than just moving a specific metric at any cost.
