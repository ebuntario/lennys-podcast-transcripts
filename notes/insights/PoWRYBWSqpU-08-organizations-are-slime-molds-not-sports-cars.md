[[concepts/coordination-cost|Coordination cost]] scales with the square of the number of people involved, a fundamental force that shapes [[concepts/organizational-design|organizational design]]. Large organizations must accept they are "slime molds" or "big rigs" and pivot less frequently, investing in process and slack. The alternative is to embrace a swarm of autonomous "sports cars," accepting some incoherence for greater speed and [[concepts/autonomy|autonomy]].
