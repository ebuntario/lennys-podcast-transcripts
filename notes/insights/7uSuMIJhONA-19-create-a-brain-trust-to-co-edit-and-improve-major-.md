When writing a book or developing a significant resource, invite a group of interested peers to review chapters and contribute ideas. This open [[concepts/team-collaboration|collaboration]] model provides free editing, surfaces blind spots, and builds a community of advocates. It turns a solitary effort into a collective project, improving quality and engagement.
