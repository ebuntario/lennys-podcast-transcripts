[[concepts/outcomes-based-pricing|Outcomes-based pricing]] fundamentally aligns a software vendor with its customer's success, transforming the relationship from transactional to partnership. This model forces the vendor to be intensely customer-centric and committed to helping achieve measurable results, as their revenue depends on it. It simplifies procurement by directly linking cost to value, moving beyond opaque bills of materials or usage metrics that may not correlate with business outcomes.
