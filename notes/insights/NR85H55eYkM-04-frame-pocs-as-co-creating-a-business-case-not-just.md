The primary goal of a [[concepts/proof-of-concept|proof of concept]] should be to co-create a business case and ROI model with the customer, not merely to demonstrate technical functionality. Agree on inputs and assumptions during the POC so the customer validates the ROI model themselves, making subsequent commercial discussions about value, not price.
