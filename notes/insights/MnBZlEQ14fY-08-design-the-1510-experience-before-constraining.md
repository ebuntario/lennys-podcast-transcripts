Instead of building a constrained MVP, first design the ideal "15 out of 10" experience without limitations. For example, design the perfect lounge for early-arriving guests before worrying about scaling to 120 countries. Then, work backward to scale the lovable aspects, ensuring the core experience remains exceptional rather than starting with a compromised version.
