To manage the tension between sales requests and product development, give the head of sales a fixed quarterly "budget" (e.g., 10% of engineering capacity or a set number of story points). This forces the sales team to prioritize their most critical asks internally. Regular meetings between product and sales leadership to review this budget create a structured, objective process instead of reactive chaos.
