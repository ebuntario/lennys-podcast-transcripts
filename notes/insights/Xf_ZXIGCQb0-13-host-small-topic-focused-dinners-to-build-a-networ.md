Organize small "guild" dinners at your home with 6-8 interesting people focused on a specific topic (e.g., AI, consumer products). Cater the food to avoid hosting stress and facilitate deep conversation. These gatherings are highly valued, foster rich connections, and become a source of learning, recruiting, and friendship that enhances both business and personal life.
