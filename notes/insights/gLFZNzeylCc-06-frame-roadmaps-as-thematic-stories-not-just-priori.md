Effective roadmaps tell a story through themes, explaining why certain areas are the biggest levers to pull for the business and users. This thematic approach creates a scaffold for teams to understand what's important and generate the "how," unlike a static spreadsheet of projects. When new learnings emerge, they can change the overarching narrative and themes more efficiently than tweaking countless granular details.
