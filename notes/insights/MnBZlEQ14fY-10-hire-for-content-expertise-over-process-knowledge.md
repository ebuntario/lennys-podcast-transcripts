Early-stage companies should prioritize hiring leaders who deeply understand the "content"—the what and when of the business—rather than those who excel at process. Content experts can roll up their sleeves and execute if their team vanishes, while process experts risk creating bureaucracy that stifles innovation. Teach process to content experts, not the other way around, to maintain strategic clarity as you scale.
