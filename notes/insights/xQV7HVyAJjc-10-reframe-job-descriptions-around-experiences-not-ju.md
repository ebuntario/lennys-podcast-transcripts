Traditional job descriptions list features (e.g., "5 years experience") which are poor proxies for fit. Rewrite them to describe the experiences a candidate will have and the progress they will make. This [[concepts/job-descriptions|experience-focused approach]] attracts people aligned with the actual work and allows for reshaping the role to fit a great candidate's strengths.
