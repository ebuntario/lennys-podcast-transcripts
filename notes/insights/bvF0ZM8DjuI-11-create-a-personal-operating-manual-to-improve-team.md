Improve team collaboration by creating a Personal Operating Manual that answers questions like: "What's your preferred communication style?", "What's a pet peeve?", and "How do you like to receive delegated tasks?". Sharing these [[concepts/working-style|working style]] preferences prevents minor friction and saves [[concepts/conflict-management|conflict]] for substantive issues. This tool fosters harmony by making implicit expectations explicit.
