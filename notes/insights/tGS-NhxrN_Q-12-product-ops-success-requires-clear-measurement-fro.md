When establishing a [[concepts/product-operations|product operations]] function, clear success metrics should be defined from the beginning, even if they're qualitative initially. Vague job descriptions without measurable outcomes signal organizational uncertainty about the role's purpose. Effective product ops leaders articulate how their work will drive specific improvements in product team efficiency, stakeholder alignment, or customer outcomes to secure buy-in and demonstrate value.
