You can constrain an AI system's autonomy in multiple ways, not just by limiting its decision steps. For example, in healthcare, an AI could autonomously approve low-risk procedures like blood tests but require human review for high-risk surgeries. This topic-based [[concepts/risk-management|risk management]] allows you to safely deploy AI in complex, regulated domains.
