Instead of broadly controlling supply, use managed tactics surgically to address specific marketplace gaps. Lyft created a rental car fleet to solve the problem of potential drivers who didn't own a car, which allowed them to manufacture supply in targeted markets and improve overall vehicle quality. This approach provided control and loyalty benefits without attempting to manage all supply.
