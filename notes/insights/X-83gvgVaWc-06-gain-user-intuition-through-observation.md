Develop intuition for how people use software by actively observing them in the wild, not just in labs studying your own product. Watch people use ATMs, point-of-sale systems, or rental car dashboards to understand the [[concepts/cognitive-friction|cognitive friction]] they experience. Increasing your [[concepts/exposure-hours|exposure hours]] to general software interaction helps build a gut feeling for what works, separate from the psychological bias of watching your own product being used.
