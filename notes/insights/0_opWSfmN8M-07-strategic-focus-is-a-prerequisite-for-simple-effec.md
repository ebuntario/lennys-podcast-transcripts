Complex, confusing pricing is often a symptom of an unfocused [[concepts/organizational-product-strategy|product strategy]] that tries to be "all things to all people." By picking a single strategic lane (e.g., customer service), you can design pricing that is simple, fair, and aligned with a core value metric. This focus eliminates the need for convoluted tiers and gates that erode customer trust.
