Relying solely on analytics or solely on customer interviews leads to suboptimal experiments. The most effective approach is a blend of [[concepts/customer-research|qualitative and quantitative research]]. Talking to customers provides essential context that makes your [[concepts/testing|experimentation]] hypotheses and tests significantly more effective.
