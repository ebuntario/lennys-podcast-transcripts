Your ability to pursue your chosen direction depends on two factors: alignment with your manager and their confidence in you. High confidence can grant you permission even with lower alignment. If both are low, you must either move toward your manager's priorities to increase alignment or deliver wins to build confidence. Continuously assess where you are on this matrix to understand your "currency" for autonomy.
