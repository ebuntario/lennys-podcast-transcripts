Figma launched out of stealth without its core differentiator (multiplayer) because the team needed momentum and real-world feedback. Look for [[concepts/product-market-fit-signals|product-market fit signals]] like users physically grabbing a laptop to try the product during demos. A launch that generates excitement and learning is more valuable than waiting for every feature to be complete.
