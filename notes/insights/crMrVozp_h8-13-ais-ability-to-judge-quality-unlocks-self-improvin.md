A significant leap in AI capability is when models like Claude Opus can reliably judge the quality of their own or others' work (e.g., writing). This [[concepts/ai-evaluation|evaluation capability]] allows for the creation of [[concepts/autonomous-systems|self-improving systems]] where an agent can generate multiple outputs, assess them, and refine its approach before presenting a result to a human. This moves AI from a simple generator to a more [[concepts/ai-agents|autonomous agent]] capable of iterative improvement.
