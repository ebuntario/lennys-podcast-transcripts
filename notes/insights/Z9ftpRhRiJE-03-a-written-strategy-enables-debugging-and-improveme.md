Every function has a strategy, but if it's not written down, it's impossible to debug misalignment or poor execution. A documented [[concepts/strategy|strategy]] allows you to identify whether issues stem from the strategy itself, misinterpretation, or inappropriate application. Writing it down is the first step to making it coherent and improvable across the organization.
