Pricing should be based on the value delivered to the customer, not on your internal costs. Intercom's Fin charges 99 cents per resolved customer support ticket, directly linking revenue to a successful [[concepts/outcome-based-pricing|outcome-based pricing]] metric. This creates a fair, predictable, and customer-obsessed relationship, contrasting with complex, multi-metric SaaS pricing that often feels unfair.
