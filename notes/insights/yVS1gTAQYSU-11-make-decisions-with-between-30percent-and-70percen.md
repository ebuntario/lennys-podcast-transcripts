A good rule for decision-making is to act when you have more than 30% but less than 70% of the potentially available data. Deciding with less than 30% is reckless, while waiting for more than 70% means you've waited too long and the opportunity may have passed. Product managers are paid to make good, timely decisions that deliver business value, which requires balancing speed with sufficient information.
