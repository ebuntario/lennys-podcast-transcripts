If a project is not on track to finish within its time box, don't just cut scope arbitrarily or extend deadlines. Instead, take it out of build mode and bring it back into [[concepts/product-shaping|shaping]] mode to resolve the fuzziness. This prevents morale-killing compromises and allows the team to address the root causes of uncertainty before reinvesting time.
