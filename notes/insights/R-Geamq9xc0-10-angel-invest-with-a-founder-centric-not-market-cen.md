Bet on exceptional founders rather than betting on markets. Great founders can pivot and create new markets, while a great market with a mediocre founder often fails. Invest in people you know, respect, and believe in, as this builds a long-term relationship and gives you optionality on all their future ventures, not just their first idea.
