The traditional model of UX research as a reactive [[concepts/service-function|service function]] is breaking down and leading to layoffs. For research to survive and thrive, researchers must be integrated into the product process from the beginning, building consistent relationships with product and design teams. Success is achieved when teams won't hold key decision-making meetings without their researcher present, transforming research into a core strategic partner.
