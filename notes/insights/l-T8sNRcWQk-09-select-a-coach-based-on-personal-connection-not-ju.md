When choosing a coach, prioritize vibe, safety, and how well they understand you over impressive credentials. Talk to multiple coaches to find a style that matches how you learn best—whether through frameworks, examples, or structure. Think of coaching as a menu of niche skills you can tap into for specific goals, not a lifelong commitment.
