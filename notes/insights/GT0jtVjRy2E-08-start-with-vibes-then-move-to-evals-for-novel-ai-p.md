When developing novel AI product experiences, begin with open-ended "vibes" testing rather than formal evals. Throw various prompts and use cases at a prototype to understand what works broadly. Once you've converged on the core use cases and form factor, then implement [[concepts/ai-evaluation|evals]] to programmatically measure improvements and A/B test changes.
