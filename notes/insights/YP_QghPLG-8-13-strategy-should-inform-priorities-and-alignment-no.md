A clear [[concepts/strategy|strategy]] provides teams with priorities, helps them align when reality changes, and reduces misalignment conflicts. Without strategy, teams craft OKRs in isolation, leading to execution problems that are actually strategy problems. Strategy should be a living tool that guides daily decisions, not just a document created annually and forgotten.
