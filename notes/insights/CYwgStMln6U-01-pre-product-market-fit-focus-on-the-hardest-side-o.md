Before achieving [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]], founders should avoid getting distracted by complex marketplace dynamics. Instead, they should identify the hardest side to acquire (often supply) and focus entirely on developing a reliable [[concepts/growth-strategy|growth strategy]] for that side, using hacks or crutches for the other side temporarily.
