Form a small [[concepts/cross-functional-collaboration|strategy working group]] with engineering, product, design, and data leads to collaboratively create the strategy. This builds inherent alignment because the output is seen as coming from the team, not just the product lead. Human psychology makes people more receptive to ideas they helped generate.
