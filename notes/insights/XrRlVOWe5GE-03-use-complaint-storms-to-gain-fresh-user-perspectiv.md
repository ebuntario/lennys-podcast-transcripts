To combat the "power user blindness" that comes from building and using your own product daily, run "Complaint-Storms." As a team, critically walk through a customer journey—starting with a competitor's product—and document every point of confusion or friction. This exercise builds collective empathy for new users and generates inspiration for improving your own [[concepts/onboarding|user experience]] by seeing problems with fresh eyes.
