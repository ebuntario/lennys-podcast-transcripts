Shift your focus from what you want to say to what you want your audience to remember—a single, clear "arrow." Support that core message with a "bow" of weighty anecdotes, data, or stories. This [[concepts/message-clarity|bow-and-arrow framework]] applies to entire talks and individual slides, ensuring each element has a definitive point and prevents audience overload.
