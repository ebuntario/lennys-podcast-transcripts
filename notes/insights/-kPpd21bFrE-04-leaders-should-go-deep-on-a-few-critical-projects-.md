Instead of staying at a high level across many projects, Revolut leaders choose 7-10 most impactful initiatives and go [[concepts/leadership-depth|deep into the details]], sometimes reading code with engineers. This signals priorities to other teams and builds discipline, as teams know they must operate autonomously at a high standard to avoid becoming the next focus area.
