A "build with writers" philosophy involves creating structured feedback loops, like a Product Lab, before rolling out fundamental changes. This invite-only group of engaged users provides early feedback on mockups and participates in pilots, ensuring the shipped product is meaningfully different and better than the initial concept, and that changes are made responsibly.
