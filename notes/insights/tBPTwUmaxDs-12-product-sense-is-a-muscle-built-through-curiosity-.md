[[concepts/product-sense|Product sense]] is not innate logic but a feeling for what is right, refined through constant curiosity and exposure to great products. Analyze why you love certain apps and articulate those reasons to train your intuition. This cultivated sense is what allows you to curate problems and envision solutions beyond what data alone can show.
