Approach your career as you would a product: start by envisioning the end state of a great career, then work backwards to define the steps (versions) to get there. This [[concepts/long-term-thinking|long-term thinking]] helps you make decisions that serve your ultimate objectives, rather than reacting to short-term frustrations like a difficult boss or slow processes. It encourages you to consider not just the next job, but the one after that.
