The core of [[concepts/product-leadership|product management]] is to bring clarity by sifting out noise to reveal the core problem, and to have conviction about the right path forward. Clarity involves transparently defining the "why" and "what," while conviction is the feeling that a chosen direction is correct, even without absolute certainty. This combination enables effective influence and decision-making.
