The most effective way to get promoted is to focus on creating [[concepts/impact|business impact]] rather than optimizing for the promotion itself. Work on the right challenges, dedicate yourself fully, and make your career ambitions known to your manager. When you are visibly focused on doing what's right for the business, advancement becomes a natural outcome of your contributions.
