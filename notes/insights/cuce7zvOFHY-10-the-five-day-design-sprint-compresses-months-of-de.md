A [[concepts/prototyping|design sprint]] is a structured five-day process to go from a big question or idea to a tested prototype. It forces teams to make decisions, build something concrete, and get customer feedback in one week, bypassing endless discussion. This is especially powerful for startups to de-risk ideas and find product-market fit before burning precious runway.
