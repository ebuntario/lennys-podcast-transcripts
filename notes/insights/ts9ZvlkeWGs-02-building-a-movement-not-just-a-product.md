To build a lasting community, provide people with something to believe in beyond utility—a philosophy or worldview. Incorporate art, soul, and fun into the project through elements like naming conventions and cultural touchpoints, which invites deeper engagement and contribution. This approach transforms users into advocates and active participants in a [[concepts/community-building|shared movement]].
