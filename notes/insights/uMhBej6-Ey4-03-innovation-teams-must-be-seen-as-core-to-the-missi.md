To avoid organizational rejection, [[concepts/innovation-teams|innovation or R&D teams]] must be perceived as working on problems core to the company's mission. The team's success should feel like everyone's success, not an isolated win. It's also critical to communicate that innovation isn't confined to that team, preventing resentment from other groups who might feel stuck with operational work.
