The value versus cost ratio of applying AI "greedily but smartly" is immense. Spending hundreds of dollars on inference costs for tasks like analyzing sales call transcripts is trivial compared to the strategic insights gained. This approach is like having a brilliant chief of staff analyze a year's worth of data instantly, providing product and marketing insights that would otherwise cost millions from a consulting firm.
