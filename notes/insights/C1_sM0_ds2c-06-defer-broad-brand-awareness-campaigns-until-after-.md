For B2B companies, avoid expensive brand awareness campaigns early on. Focus first on bottom-of-funnel channels where users actively seek solutions to immediate problems. Once you have validated messaging and a steady conversion flow, you can invest in broader awareness to reinforce your position, as demonstrated by companies like Notion launching out-of-home ads later in their journey.
