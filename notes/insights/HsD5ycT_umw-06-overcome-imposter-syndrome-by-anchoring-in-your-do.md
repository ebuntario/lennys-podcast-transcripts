Combat [[concepts/imposter-syndrome|imposter syndrome]] by identifying a specific area where you have deep, legitimate expertise—no matter how niche. Lead discussions from this anchor of confidence, as people respect genuine mastery. This technique builds credibility that extends to other areas, rather than trying to project competence in domains where you feel insecure.
