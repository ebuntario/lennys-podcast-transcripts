Hosting customer events follows a counterintuitive cost curve. Small meetups or steak dinners are cheap and highly effective for building relationships. However, large-scale conferences have massive diseconomies of scale, with costs soaring to $1,000-$2,000 per attendee for major venues. The financial risk is enormous, which is why many large tech companies have scaled back their own large events.
