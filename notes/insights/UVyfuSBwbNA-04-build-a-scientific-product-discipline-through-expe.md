A key challenge in [[concepts/product-leadership|product management]] is that everyone feels they can do the job because it often lacks a defined science. Building a strong [[concepts/testing|experimentation culture]] changes this by making product decisions scientific. It empowers PMs to defend decisions with data from past tests, transforming their role from a generalist to a specialist.
