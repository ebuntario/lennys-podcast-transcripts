Saying a company is design-led does not mean it's designer-led. A true [[concepts/design-culture|design culture]] is a mindset that can be held by anyone in any role, fostering organizational alignment around vision and philosophy. This creates a strategic advantage where all parts of the company ladder up into one cohesive, sensical whole, allowing for greater operational efficiency and a smaller, more effective team.
