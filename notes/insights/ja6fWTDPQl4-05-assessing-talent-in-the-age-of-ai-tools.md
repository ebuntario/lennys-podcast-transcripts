Modern [[concepts/talent-assessment|talent assessment]] should not fight against AI tool usage but should evaluate what a person can accomplish *with* those tools. For example, instead of forbidding AI in an interview, give candidates access to ChatGPT and coding assistants and ask them to build a website in an hour. The measure of success shifts to output and leverage, not raw, unaided skill.
