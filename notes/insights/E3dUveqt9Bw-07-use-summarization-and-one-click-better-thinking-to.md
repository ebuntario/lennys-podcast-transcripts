A powerful tactic for [[concepts/strategic-thinking|strategic thinking]] is active [[concepts/facilitation|summarization]] during discussions—synthesizing diverse viewpoints and checking for alignment. This alone is often viewed as strategic work. Then, focus on making the synthesized idea "one click better" by refining it from an outside-in, customer-centric perspective, which leads to substantive, actionable strategic ideas.
