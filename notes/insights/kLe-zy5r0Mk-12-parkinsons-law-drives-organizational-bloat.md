[[concepts/parkinsons-law|Parkinson's Law]] (work expands to fill the time available) manifests in organizations as a tendency for people to want to hire more reports, correlating with career trajectory and authority. This isn't due to malice or stupidity, but a smart, almost overpowering impulse within complex systems. Leaders must actively manage this to prevent bureaucratic bloat and ensure headcount growth aligns with genuine need.
