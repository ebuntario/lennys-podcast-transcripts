You achieve [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]] when you iterate a solution to the point where your target customers are willing to be a reference—to advocate for it publicly. This is a stronger signal than mere usage or satisfaction, as it requires customers to stake their own reputation on your product's value.
