Product managers often hold misconceptions that damage the researcher partnership, such as "research is too slow," "I can do my own research," or "we should just A/B test everything." These tropes are flawed; good research can be fast, avoids the garbage-in-garbage-out problem of amateur outreach, and explains the "why" behind A/B test results that data alone cannot provide.
