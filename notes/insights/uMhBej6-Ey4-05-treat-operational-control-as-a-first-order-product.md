For [[concepts/operational-products|products with heavy operational components]] (like ride-sharing marketplaces), operational control and flexibility must be a first-order design requirement. Algorithms alone can't respond to local events like snowstorms, tax changes, or competitor moves. Product design must include interfaces that give human operators the information and tools to make strategic judgments, which algorithms then execute at scale.
