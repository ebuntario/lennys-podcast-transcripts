At the earliest stages, focusing on whether you're building something people want is more important than [[concepts/market-size|market size]] calculations. Companies like Razorpay (payment processing in India) and Whatnot (Funko Pop marketplaces) started in seemingly small markets that later expanded dramatically. Early investors should prioritize product-market fit signals over spreadsheet projections of total addressable market.
