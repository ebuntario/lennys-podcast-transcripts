Every career and company has an A-side (highlights and successes) and a B-side (struggles and failures), but people often only share the A-side publicly. Recognizing that B-moments are normal and temporary helps build [[concepts/resilience|resilience]] and prevents discouragement during setbacks. Sharing both sides authentically can inspire others and provide a more realistic picture of growth.
