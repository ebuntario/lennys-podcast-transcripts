To break out of established thought patterns when working with AI, deliberately ask for the opposite of your natural approach. If you tend to be nice, explicitly ask the AI to "be brutal" or "roast" your work. This technique helps surface blind spots and generates more critical, diverse feedback than you'd get from [[concepts/prompt-engineering|standard prompting approaches]].
