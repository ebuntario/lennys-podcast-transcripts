Unlike investor pitches that can focus on long-term disruption, sales pitches must deliver immediate, tangible value. Buyers exchange money for solutions now, not theoretical futures. Avoid overly futuristic claims that give buyers reasons to delay, and instead demonstrate concrete benefits they can realize quickly after purchase.
