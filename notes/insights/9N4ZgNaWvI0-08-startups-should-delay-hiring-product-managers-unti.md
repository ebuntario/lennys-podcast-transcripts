In early-stage startups, the founder's core job is to ensure value and viability—the very role of a true product manager. Hiring a product manager too soon creates conflict and slows down decision-making. A good heuristic is to wait until you have around 20-25 engineers, which typically corresponds with scaling beyond the initial [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]] phase.
