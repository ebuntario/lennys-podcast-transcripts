Maintain a startup mentality of flexibility and run small tests, even on ideas you initially resist. Anchor hesitated to add podcast export features but ran a test anyway, which triggered hockey-stick growth. You never know which tiny product change will become an existential moment for your business, so stay open to new information as your user base and product mature.
