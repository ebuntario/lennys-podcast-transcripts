In sales-led or hybrid growth models, the interaction mechanism between product and customer-facing teams (sales, success, support) must be extremely tight. This is a two-way street: product must efficiently gather frontline customer insights from these teams, and must equally ensure those teams are fully equipped to communicate product changes and roadmap accurately to customers. Experiment with formats like "science fairs" to facilitate deep, interactive knowledge transfer.
