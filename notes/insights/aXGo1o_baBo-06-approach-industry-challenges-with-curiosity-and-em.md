When facing systemic challenges like being a woman in tech, adopt a mindset of curiosity about the structural and cultural roots of the issue, rather than frustration. Pair this curiosity with a sense of personal [[concepts/agency|empowerment]], knowing your value and that you can influence change. This combination allows you to navigate difficulties constructively and work to improve the industry for others.
