Aim for 50-100% annual headcount growth as a sustainable maximum; exceeding 100% creates predictable chaos. Faster growth leads to duplicated roles, misalignment, and managerial overload because systems can't de-duplicate issues quickly enough. More people often slow progress, so hire for precise need and quality, not just to fill a growth target, and question every new role to prevent redundancy.
