When people change jobs, the primary driver is the [[concepts/progress-theory|progress]] they seek—such as new skills, better balance, or more respect—not just a higher salary. Over 50% of people who get new jobs don't receive more money. When money is cited, it's often a proxy for deeper needs like status, responsibility, or a metric of personal advancement. Understanding the specific progress a person is trying to make is key to attracting and retaining talent.
