In [[concepts/product-led-sales]], leads come from three distinct buckets with different conversion rates: usage with a [[concepts/product-qualified-lead]] (user equals buyer), usage without a lead (requires marketing to find the buyer), and leads without usage (traditional top-down). Recognizing these different [[concepts/lead-attribution]] sources allows for tailored sales approaches and prevents the common mistake of treating all product sign-ups as immediate sales opportunities.
