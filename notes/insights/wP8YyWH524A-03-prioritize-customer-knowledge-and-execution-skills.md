When hiring less experienced growth practitioners, prioritize candidates with strong [[concepts/customer-knowledge|customer knowledge]] and [[concepts/growth-execution|growth execution]] skills. These foundational competencies are harder to teach than strategic thinking or influence. Internal hires often excel in customer knowledge since they already understand the user base, leading to faster time-to-results.
