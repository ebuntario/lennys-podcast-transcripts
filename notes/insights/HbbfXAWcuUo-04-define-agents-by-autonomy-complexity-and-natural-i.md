Effective [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agents]] can be defined by three key principles: increasing autonomy for higher-order task delegation, handling complex multi-step workflows (not just one-shot tasks), and enabling natural interactions beyond simple chat. These agents should work asynchronously, providing superpowers by connecting insights and performing work even when you're not actively engaged.
