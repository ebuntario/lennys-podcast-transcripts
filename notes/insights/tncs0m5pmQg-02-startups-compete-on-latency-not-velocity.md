A startup's primary advantage over large companies is not the speed or quantity of work (velocity) but the short cycle time from idea to validation (latency). Startups can have an idea one day and test it the next, enabling rapid learning. This tight "turning radius" allows for faster iteration and hypothesis testing compared to larger organizations with more momentum and resources.
