Barriers to user action come in two forms: logistical (like form fields) and cognitive (like [[concepts/uncertainty-aversion|uncertainty aversion]] or [[concepts/status-quo-bias|status quo bias]]). Effective product design must identify and reduce both types of [[concepts/friction|friction]] to help users overcome inertia and adopt new behaviors.
