While category creation can work, positioning as a modern, superior solution within an existing category (like Ironclad did with CLM software) is often a faster path to demand. Buyers are already searching for solutions in established categories and have budget allocated, reducing education overhead. You can then expand the category's definition with your unique advantages.
