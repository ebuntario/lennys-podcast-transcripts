To advance your career, frame your ambitions around solving a critical problem for the company, not just your personal growth. Create a clear proposal showing how a new role or structure you could fill would benefit the organization, making it easy for leadership to say yes. This shifts the conversation from "I want a promotion" to "here's how I can create leverage and value for the team."
