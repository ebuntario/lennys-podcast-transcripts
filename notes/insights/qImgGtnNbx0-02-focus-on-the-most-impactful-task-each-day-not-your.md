A key leadership principle is to ask yourself each morning, "What is the most impactful thing I could do today?" This requires overcoming the subconscious tendency to focus on tasks you enjoy or are good at, like engineering or product design, even when they are not the highest leverage activities. Success comes from deriving joy from [[concepts/impact-maximization|impact and organizational success]] rather than from the specific act of performing familiar tasks.
