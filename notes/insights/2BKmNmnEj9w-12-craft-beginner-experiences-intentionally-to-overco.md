The first steps in learning a new skill (like chess or a language) are often fraught with self-doubt. Intentionally craft the [[concepts/user-onboarding|beginner experience]] to guide users around this friction. For example, hide ratings for the first few games, emphasize positive reinforcement after losses, or offer alternative starting activities like playing against a bot instead of jumping into a competitive live game.
