A bootstrapped, profitable-from-day-one [[concepts/organizational-culture|company culture]] ingrains a direct connection between work and revenue in every team member, even engineers. This forces rigorous prioritization, as every project is evaluated by its potential to contribute to sustainable growth. While this focus is a strength, at scale it must be balanced with the need to invest ahead of growth in new products and markets.
