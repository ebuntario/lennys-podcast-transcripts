In high-growth tech roles, a key indicator of burnout is a noticeable drop in adaptability—resistance to change, experimentation, or revisiting previously failed ideas. Whereas exhausted individuals might still find renewal in new challenges, burnt-out team members often seek to minimize effort and stick to routine. Leaders should watch for this shift in [[concepts/adaptability|flexibility]] and encourage open discussions about workload and mental well-being before performance suffers.
