Break ideas into their underlying assumptions and test those individually to maintain a sustainable discovery pace. Teams should be able to run multiple [[concepts/assumption-testing|assumption tests]] across several ideas each week, comparing solutions rather than getting stuck on lengthy experiments. This approach enables continuous learning and prevents discovery from becoming a bottleneck.
