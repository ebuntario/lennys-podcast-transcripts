When navigating social expectations, develop a simple, relatable story about what you're doing, even if it's an exploration. Using terms like "I'm an entrepreneur," "I'm a business owner," or "I'm tinkering with some writing" can satisfy others' need for a legible label. This reduces friction and judgment, allowing you to focus on your path without constantly defending it.
