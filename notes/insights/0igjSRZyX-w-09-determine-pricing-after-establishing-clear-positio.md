First, establish a clear [[concepts/product-positioning|positioning]] (e.g., "the best email tool for high performers"). Then use methods like the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter to find the price point where your product "starts to get expensive" but users still see the ROI and purchase. This price supports a premium position, unlike bargain pricing which aims for maximum top-of-funnel growth.
