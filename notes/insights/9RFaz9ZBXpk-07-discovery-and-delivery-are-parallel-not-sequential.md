Avoid stopping delivery to do discovery; instead, maintain both activities in parallel. Everything you build is a bet, and discovery simply helps you make better bets over time. This mindset prevents teams from falling into the trap of "no time for discovery" and allows for continuous improvement of decision-making while maintaining delivery momentum.
