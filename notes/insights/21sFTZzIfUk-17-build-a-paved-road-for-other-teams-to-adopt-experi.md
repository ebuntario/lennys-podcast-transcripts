The efficacy of a growth org should also be measured by how it enables and uplevels the rest of the organization. Create a "paved road" for adoption of behavioral analytics and experimentation stacks, coach other teams on getting started, and build internal education programs and tools for metrics design. This allows every R&D team to leverage experimentation where appropriate, spreading [[concepts/data-driven-decisions|data-driven development]] practices and maximizing the impact of shared learnings across the company.
