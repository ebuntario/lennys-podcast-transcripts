The rise of capable base models has created the role of the [[concepts/ai-engineering|AI engineer]], who uses existing models as a service to build applications, unlike the [[concepts/ml-engineering|ML engineer]] who traditionally built models from scratch. This lowers the entry barrier and expands the possibilities for AI-powered products.
