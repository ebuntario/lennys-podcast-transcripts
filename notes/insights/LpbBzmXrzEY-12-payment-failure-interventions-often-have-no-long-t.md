Experiments that improve payment failure recovery (like better dunning emails) often show strong short-term lifts but minimal long-term impact on customer value. Users who let payments lapse typically have lower engagement and commitment, so recovering them doesn't significantly change their long-term trajectory. This insight challenges the assumption that all [[concepts/customer-retention|retention improvements]] create equal value.
