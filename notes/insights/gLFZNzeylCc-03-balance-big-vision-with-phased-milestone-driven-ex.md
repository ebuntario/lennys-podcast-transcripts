While companies need to dream big to innovate, they must couple that vision with thoughtful execution. Define clear phases for learning and prototyping, and articulate what success looks like in small intervals with go/no-go milestones. This approach prevents investing years in a failing path and allows for course correction based on learnings from shorter, defined periods.
