High performers often plateau because the very strength that made them successful (their superpower) creates a blind spot or "shadow." For example, a decisive entrepreneur may struggle with collaboration at the executive level, or a great collaborator may avoid presenting strong opinions. To identify this, scrutinize contradictory feedback you've dismissed. The work to advance often requires rewiring how you apply your core strength, not abandoning it.
