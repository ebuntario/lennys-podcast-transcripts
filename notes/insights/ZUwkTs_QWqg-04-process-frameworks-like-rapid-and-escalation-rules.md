In complex, interconnected product ecosystems, explicit [[concepts/operational-processes|operational processes]] are necessary to maintain velocity. LinkedIn uses the RAPID framework (Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, Decide) to clarify decision ownership and a "five-day escalation rule" to ensure blockers are quickly elevated. These systems provide clear tiebreakers and accountability when multiple teams and business models intersect.
