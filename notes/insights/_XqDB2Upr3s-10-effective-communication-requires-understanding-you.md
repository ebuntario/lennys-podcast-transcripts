To communicate effectively, you must first understand your audience's mental model, fears, and current knowledge. Use multiple modalities (spoken, written, visual) and repetition to ensure the message lands. Acknowledge known concerns upfront to build trust, as people won't listen to your conclusions if they doubt you understand the premise.
