Pricing should not be siloed in one department. Form a cross-functional committee involving product, growth, data, sales, and finance. This team owns the iterative [[concepts/value-based-pricing|pricing strategy]], conducts customer research, and ensures pricing decisions are informed by both user value and business goals.
