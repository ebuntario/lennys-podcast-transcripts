In any category, roughly 8-10% of buyers (super consumers) drive the majority of profits and act as the zeitgeist and thought leaders. For [[concepts/category-design|category design]], identify these super consumers—your ideal customer profile—and understand where they congregate digitally. Engage with them not as a seller, but as an educator sharing a radical new point of view about a problem. When they have an "aha" moment, they become powerful advocates, driving word-of-mouth and adoption for your new category.
