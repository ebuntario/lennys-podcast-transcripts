Product work occurs at three levels: impact (the ultimate effect on customers/business), execution (the tasks to get something done), and optics (creating awareness of the work). Many team conflicts arise because individuals default to thinking at different levels—for example, a PM focused on execution details while a CEO thinks about impact. Recognizing and aligning on which level matters most in a given context resolves tension and improves collaboration.
