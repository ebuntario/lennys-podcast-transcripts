A company's [[concepts/organizational-culture|culture]]—"the way we do things around here"—is overwhelmingly shaped by the founder's personality, not by written values or initiatives. Operators should focus on articulating and extending this inherent culture, not trying to reshape it. Misalignment occurs when stated values conflict with the founder's actual behaviors, so culture is defined by daily actions and decisions, not aspirational slogans.
