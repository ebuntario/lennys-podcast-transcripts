Abstract [[concepts/organizational-culture|company culture]] values like "ownership" or "team-collaboration" only become meaningful when translated into specific, observable behaviors. Different organizational contexts interpret these values differently—individualistic versus collectivist cultures manifest ownership in distinct ways. Clear behavioral examples make cultural expectations concrete and actionable for teams.
