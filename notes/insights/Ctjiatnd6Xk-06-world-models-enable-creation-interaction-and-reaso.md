A world model is a foundation that allows users to generate any environment through prompts and then navigate, modify, and reason within it. This goes beyond passive video generation by providing a structured, [[concepts/spatial-intelligence|interactive 3D representation]] that agents (like robots) or humans can use for planning and simulation. Applications range from virtual production and game development to robotic training and psychological research.
