AI tools enable domain specialists (e.g., sales, finance) to build their own custom software in minutes. This disrupts vertical SaaS companies whose moat was that each client only needed 10% of their features but couldn't build that 10% themselves. The future favors bespoke, integrated tools over generic, feature-bloated platforms.
