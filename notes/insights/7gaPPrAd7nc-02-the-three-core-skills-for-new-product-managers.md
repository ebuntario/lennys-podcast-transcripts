For new PMs, the foundational skills to master are [[concepts/communication|communication]], [[concepts/prioritization|prioritization]], and execution. Clear communication tests and sharpens your thinking, prioritization determines your leverage and impact, and execution ensures you deliver what you promise. These core building blocks are more critical early on than skills like thinking big or understanding technical trade-offs.
