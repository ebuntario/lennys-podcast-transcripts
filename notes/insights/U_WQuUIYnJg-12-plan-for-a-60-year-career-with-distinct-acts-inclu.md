Modern professionals may have 60-year careers. It's useful to think in acts: Act One (learning/building), Act Two (building the factory/management), and a long Act Three. Many hit a mental health crisis in Act Three because they achieved their North Star (e.g., VP, founder) and feel lost. To avoid this, plan early for Act Three, which often shifts focus from scaling personal economics to [[concepts/purpose|giving]]—through coaching, content, mission-based work, or volunteering—which can provide deep fulfillment for decades.
