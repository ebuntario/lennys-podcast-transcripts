Your brain operates in different wave states: alpha (daydreaming/idea generation), beta (productive "get stuff done" mode), and gamma (deep, intense focus on complex problems). Most teams over-index on beta. Aim to spend roughly 25% of your time in alpha and gamma states through practices like scheduled deep work blocks or quarterly off-sites.
