Effective [[concepts/negotiation-strategy|negotiation]] involves three components: always asking for something in return when giving a concession (gives-and-gets), creating needs and affirmation loops during value selling, and presenting multiple options to shift the conversation from price to value. Taper concessions (e.g., 15%, then 5%, then 2%) to signal the negotiation is ending.
