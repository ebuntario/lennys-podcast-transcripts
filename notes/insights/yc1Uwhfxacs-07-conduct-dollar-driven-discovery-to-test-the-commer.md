Move beyond general customer chats to structured conversations that test a hypothesis's dollar potential. Focus on identifying "extreme value" by asking about goals and pains without leading the witness. Then, probe for ability and willingness to pay by asking about existing budgets, decision processes, and using price-anchoring questions ("What's a fair price? An expensive price? A prohibitively expensive price?").
