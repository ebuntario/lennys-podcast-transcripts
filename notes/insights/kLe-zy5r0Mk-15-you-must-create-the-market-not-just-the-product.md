If your product is meaningfully different, you are responsible for creating its market, not just building it. It's easier to position a product by connecting existing ideas (e.g., "Uber for X") than to implant a wholly new concept. The "We Don't Sell Saddles Here" memo emphasizes selling the outcome (horseback riding) and the experience, not just the product feature (the saddle).
