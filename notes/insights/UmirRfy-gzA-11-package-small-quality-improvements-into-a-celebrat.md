Dedicate engineering time to "quality weeks" focused on fixing small user annoyances gathered from support and Twitter. Bundle these many minor improvements into a single launch (e.g., "Little Big Updates") and credit the user feedback that inspired each fix. This shows users you listen, directly improves their daily [[concepts/product-quality|product quality]], and builds immense goodwill.
