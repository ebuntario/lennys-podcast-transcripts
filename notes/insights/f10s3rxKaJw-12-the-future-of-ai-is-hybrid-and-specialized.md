General-purpose LLMs have limitations based on their training data and statistical nature. The future will involve a [[concepts/hybrid-ai-models|hybrid AI landscape]] where specialized, fine-tuned models handle niche, high-safety domains (like aerospace), while multiple LLMs collaborate for broader tasks. This balances generality with precision.
