[[concepts/strategic-thinking|Strategic thinking]] is a two-part formula: first, the ability to articulate a simple, compelling "why" behind decisions and direction. Second, the willingness to champion and be a [[concepts/change-management|change agent]] for difficult, long-term initiatives. Missing either component—big ideas without clear rationale, or clear rationale without substantive action—means you won't be perceived as strategic.
