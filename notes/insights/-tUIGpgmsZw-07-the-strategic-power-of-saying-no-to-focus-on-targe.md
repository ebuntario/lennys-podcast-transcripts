One of the hardest but most impactful strategic moves is clearly defining your target market and personas, and having the discipline to say "no" to opportunities outside that focus. This creates clarity for prioritization, allowing teams to build something amazing for the people that matter most rather than something average for a broad audience. A culture that values focused execution is critical for this to work.
