Evaluate features using an S-shaped [[concepts/utility-curve|utility curve]], where the horizontal axis is effort/cost and the vertical axis is value/quality. The goal is to identify whether you are on the shallow initial part of the curve (needing more investment), the steep valuable part, or the plateau of diminishing returns. This helps decide whether a feature is worth further investment or is already "good enough."
