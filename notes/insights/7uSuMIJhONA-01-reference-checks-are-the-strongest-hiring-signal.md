Reference checks provide a more reliable signal than interviews because they reveal how a candidate performed over years in real work scenarios. A 30-minute interview with artificial scenarios cannot compare to the depth of insight from people who have collaborated with the candidate extensively. To get honest feedback, ask reference providers to contrast the candidate with others on their team without revealing who you're evaluating.
