The [[concepts/product-strategy-stack|Product Strategy Stack]] is a system that separates conflated terms like goals and strategy into distinct, hierarchical layers: Company Mission → Company Strategy → Product Strategy → Roadmap → Goals. This framework helps teams define strategy from the top down and debug tactical issues from the bottom up, ensuring day-to-day work ladders up to the overarching mission.
