A critical skill for product managers, especially in enterprise contexts, is learning to ask the right questions to understand the *why* behind a customer request. The goal is to avoid building custom features for individual customers and instead identify the underlying, scalable problem. This preserves a clean user experience and allows you to build a single solution that meets the needs of a broad swath of customers.
