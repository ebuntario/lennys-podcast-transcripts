Most entrepreneurs and companies unconsciously decide to compete in an existing market by offering a better product, service, or brand, fighting to capture a share of pre-existing demand. This is the "Better" Trap. Data shows that in tech categories, the category king earns about 76% of the total market value, meaning competitors are left fighting for the remaining 24%. Instead of competing for this slice, the goal should be to [[concepts/demand-creation|create new demand]] by designing a new category where you can earn the dominant share.
