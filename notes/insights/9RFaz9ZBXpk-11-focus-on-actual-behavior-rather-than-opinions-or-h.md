Since product work is about changing behavior, ground your research in what people actually do, not what they say they would do. Ask about specific past experiences to uncover reliable behavioral patterns, avoiding the "garbage in, garbage out" problem of hypothetical questions. This focus on real actions provides a stronger foundation for design decisions.
