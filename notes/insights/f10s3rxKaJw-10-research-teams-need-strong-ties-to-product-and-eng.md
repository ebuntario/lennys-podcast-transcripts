Research teams (like GitHub Next) must maintain synergy with product and engineering to transition ideas into production. Successful applied research focuses on making things real from day one, avoiding the trap of becoming an isolated "university" that only writes papers. This connection ensures future-thinking innovations are grounded in practical implementation.
