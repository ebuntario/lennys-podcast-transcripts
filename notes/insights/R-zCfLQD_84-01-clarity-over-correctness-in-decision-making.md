The principle "we might be wrong, but we are not confused" prioritizes [[concepts/decision-making|clarity of thought and execution]] over being right. It's more important for a team to have a unified direction and clear understanding of the problem than to hedge bets with multiple conflicting ideas. This approach creates a chance for success, whereas confusion only leaves success to luck.
