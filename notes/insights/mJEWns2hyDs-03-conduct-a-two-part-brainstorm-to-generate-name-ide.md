An effective naming brainstorm has two parts. First, extract key words from your positioning statement and run exercises on synonyms, antonyms, and free associations. Second, conduct a thematic brainstorm using 7-10 themes related to your domain (e.g., history, famous figures, core concepts) to generate more evocative ideas. This structured approach helps move from hundreds of ideas to a shortlist of promising candidates.
