Intuition functions as a [[concepts/hypothesis-testing|hypothesis generator]] for product decisions, not as a final answer. You generate these hypotheses, then debate them and seek data to either support or negate them, ultimately winnowing them down to a working hypothesis. This framework treats gut feeling as the starting point for structured inquiry rather than the conclusion.
