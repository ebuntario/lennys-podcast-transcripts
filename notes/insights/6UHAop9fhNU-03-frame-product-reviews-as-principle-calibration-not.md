The goal of a [[concepts/product-reviews|product review]] should be to calibrate on principles, not to get a single decision. Discuss the trade-offs, who you're optimizing for, and the risk tolerance behind a recommendation. This builds organizational capacity for consistent, high-quality [[concepts/decision-making|decision-making]] without requiring constant executive oversight.
