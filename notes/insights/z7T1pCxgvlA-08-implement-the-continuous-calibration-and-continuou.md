The [[concepts/continuous-calibration|CC/CD framework]] is an iterative lifecycle for AI products. The "Continuous Development" side involves scoping capabilities, curating data, and setting up evaluation metrics. The "Continuous Calibration" side involves deploying, analyzing real user behavior for unexpected patterns, and applying fixes. This loop minimizes risk and builds a reliable feedback flywheel.
