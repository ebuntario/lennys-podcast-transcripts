Advance by pursuing roles and projects where you have strong personal conviction and believe you can make a dent, rather than chasing what is conventionally in-demand or challenging. For product professionals, you are ultimately measured by the [[concepts/impact|impact of the products you built and what you learned]], not by company logos or titles. Work on the core of the business where impact is highest.
