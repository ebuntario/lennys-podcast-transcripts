True [[concepts/skill-development|skill development]] comes from completing full practice loops—strategy, modeling, prioritization, execution, measurement, and learning integration—not just consuming content. Teams should create opportunities to run these cycles repeatedly, even in constrained environments. This hands-on experience builds competence more effectively than passive knowledge gathering alone.
