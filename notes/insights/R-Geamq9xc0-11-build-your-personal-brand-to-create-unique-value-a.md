Differentiate yourself by publishing non-obvious insights and building a [[concepts/personal-branding|personal brand]] online. When people search for you, the first results should be your articles or content, not just your LinkedIn profile. This clarifies what you stand for, attracts opportunities (like deal flow for investing), and demonstrates the unique value you can offer to founders and companies.
