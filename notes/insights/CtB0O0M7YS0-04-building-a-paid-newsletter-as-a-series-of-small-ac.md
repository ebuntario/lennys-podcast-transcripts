Instead of treating a newsletter launch as a permanent commitment, frame it as a time-boxed experiment. Set a clear period (e.g., six months) to dedicate full effort, with a pre-defined plan to refund subscribers if it doesn't gain traction. This approach reduces the psychological risk and makes the venture feel more like a [[concepts/iterative-launch|startup experiment]] than an irreversible career leap.
