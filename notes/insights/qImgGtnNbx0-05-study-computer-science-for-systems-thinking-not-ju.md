As AI transforms coding from typing to operating a code-generating machine, the enduring value of a computer science education is [[concepts/systems-thinking|systems thinking]], not syntax. Understanding algorithms, complexity, and how components interact is crucial for designing robust systems and effectively directing AI. This foundational knowledge will remain essential even as the tools for creating software evolve dramatically.
