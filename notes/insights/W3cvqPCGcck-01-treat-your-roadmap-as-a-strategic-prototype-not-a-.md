A roadmap should be viewed as a [[concepts/strategic-prototype|prototype for your strategy]], not a definitive delivery plan. Its primary value lies in the collaborative process of laying out and testing your assumptions about the problems you intend to solve. By sharing this early thinking with your team and customers, you can validate your direction and refine your approach before committing to execution.
