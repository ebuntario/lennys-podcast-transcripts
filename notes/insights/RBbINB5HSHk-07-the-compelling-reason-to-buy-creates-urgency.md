A pragmatist's default mode is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." To overcome this inertia, you need a "compelling reason to buy"—a severe, deteriorating problem (like ransomware risk or operational churn) that creates enough duress to force action. This urgency pushes them through their normally slow, risk-averse buying process.
