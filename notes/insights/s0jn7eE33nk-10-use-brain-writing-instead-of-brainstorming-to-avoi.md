Founders' voices carry disproportionate weight in live brainstorming, stifling introverts and slow processors. [[concepts/meeting-facilitation|Brain writing]] involves async written input (e.g., in a shared doc) before discussion, anonymizing contributions. This surfaces diverse ideas, dampens the founder effect, and leads to better decisions.
