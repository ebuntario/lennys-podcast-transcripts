Instead of writing a script and memorizing it, use the Accordion Method: give your talk in successively shorter timeframes (e.g., 3 min, 2 min, 1 min) to distill the essence, then expand back up. This process internalizes the talk, provides clarity, and makes it adaptable to different time constraints. It's like redecorating a room by first removing everything non-essential, then intentionally adding back only what serves the vision.
