Effective [[concepts/feedback|feedback delivery]] starts by explicitly stating your care for the person and your desire for their success—this establishes psychological safety. Then, be direct but frame the feedback around perception: "This is how you're being perceived, which may differ from your intent." This [[concepts/communication|invites collaborative problem-solving]] on how to align intent with impact, rather than putting the recipient on the defensive.
