If someone becomes defensive during a [[concepts/difficult-conversations|difficult conversation]], pause and acknowledge the shift in energy. A script like "I can see this is upsetting you, and I want you to know my intention is to help you succeed" reaffirms your supportive role. This allows you to de-escalate the situation and offers the option to continue the conversation later, maintaining focus on the underlying issue rather than the reaction.
