A key [[concepts/product-led-growth|product-led growth]] lever is allowing unlimited collaborators on a free team, even with a file limit. Figma initially limited collaborators and saw better growth after switching to limit files instead. This removes friction for internal champions to spread the tool, giving teams time to build confidence before hitting a paywall.
