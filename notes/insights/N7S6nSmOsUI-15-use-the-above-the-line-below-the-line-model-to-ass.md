Conscious leadership involves recognizing whether you are operating "above the line" (committed to learning, open, curious, playful) or "below the line" (committed to being right, defensive, seeing things as black and white). Developing the [[concepts/self-awareness|self-awareness]] to identify your current state allows you to consciously choose to shift above the line, fostering more productive, collaborative, and creative conversations.
