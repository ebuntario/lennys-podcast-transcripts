When hiring mission-critical talent, recruit the entire executive team to help with the close, as all leaders understand the importance of bringing in top people. Furthermore, involve the candidate's spouse and family in the process, as a career change is a deeply personal decision that affects the whole household. This holistic approach builds a stronger connection and addresses potential barriers to joining.
