Track the time from insight to shipped value across stages (problem definition, solution, shipping, metric movement). By making this data visible, teams can benchmark their cycle times against peers and past performance. This turns [[concepts/development-velocity|velocity improvement]] into a game of golf—competing against your own past performance to identify and eliminate inefficiencies.
