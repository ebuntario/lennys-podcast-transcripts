The romanticized version of [[concepts/startup-culture|startup life]] often omits the intense personal sacrifice required. In the early days, engineers handled everything from building servers to running anti-spam systems, often working extreme hours with little support. This path is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that is far from glamorous in the moment, even if it pays off later for some.
