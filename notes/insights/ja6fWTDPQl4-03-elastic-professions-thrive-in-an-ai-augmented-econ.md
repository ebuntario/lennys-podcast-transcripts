Professions with [[concepts/elastic-demand|elastic demand]], like software engineering and product management, will thrive as AI makes workers more productive because the world will demand 10x or 100x more output from these fields. In contrast, fields with inelastic demand may not see increased need despite productivity gains. The key is to focus on domains where increased productivity directly expands total market demand.
