Approach managerial challenges, even difficult ones like letting someone go, with a win-win mindset. Frame decisions around how they can ultimately serve the other person's growth and success, not just the team's immediate needs. This collaborative, [[concepts/ethical-leadership|respectful approach]] builds trust and often leads to better long-term outcomes for everyone involved.
