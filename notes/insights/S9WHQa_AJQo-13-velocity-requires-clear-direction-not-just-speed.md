Many organizations confuse speed with [[concepts/velocity-vs-speed|velocity]], which includes both pace and direction. The "slow is smooth, smooth is fast" principle emphasizes that taking time for clarity upfront enables faster execution later. Teams should establish clear destination vectors before accelerating to avoid wasted effort on misaligned initiatives.
