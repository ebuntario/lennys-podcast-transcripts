Structure your [[concepts/testing|experimentation]] portfolio to avoid incrementalism. Allocate most energy (e.g., 80%) to "cannonballs"—big, fundamental changes—and the remainder to "lead bullets"—smaller optimizations. Early-stage products should focus almost entirely on cannonballs; as products mature, the balance can shift toward refinement. This prevents teams from favoring easy, low-impact tests over meaningful bets.
