If you're not passionate about your current project, your scope is not limited to it. Understand your company's broader vision and your users to find an idea within that space you are passionate about. Anyone can be a founder inside a company by leveraging its distribution and platform advantages, though it requires securing buy-in rather than making unilateral decisions.
