For [[concepts/consumer-subscription|consumer subscription]] companies, [[concepts/user-retention|user retention]] is gold. If you don't retain users, the pressure is on getting them to pay immediately, which is very difficult. Aim for D1 retention around 30-40% as a solid baseline, but focus even more on existing user retention, as that compounds and builds the daily habit essential for long-term growth.
