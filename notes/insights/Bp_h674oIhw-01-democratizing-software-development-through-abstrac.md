The core vision of [[concepts/software-democratization|democratizing software development]] is to remove the fragmented, cumbersome process of setting up IDEs, runtimes, package managers, and deployment. By abstracting away this complexity into a single, learnable platform, the barrier to creating software is significantly lowered. This enables a wider range of people, from product managers to lawyers, to build tools and applications.
