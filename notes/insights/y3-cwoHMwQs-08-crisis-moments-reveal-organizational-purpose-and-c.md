During crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations must blow up existing roadmaps and reorient around immediate public needs. These moments test and reveal an organization's true purpose and capability to deliver value beyond commercial metrics. The unifying effect comes from teams knowing their work serves a greater good, even amid personal and professional challenges.
