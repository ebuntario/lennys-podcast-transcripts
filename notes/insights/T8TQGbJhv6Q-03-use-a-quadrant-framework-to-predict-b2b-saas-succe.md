Evaluate B2B SaaS ideas on two axes: how many departments use the workflow (niche vs. everyone) and how frequently it's executed (infrequent vs. frequent). The most predictably successful quadrant is high-frequency niche workflows (e.g., Jira for developers, Salesforce for sales), as they solve a sharp, mission-critical problem for a defined group. This framework helps founders and investors assess the probability of success before investing years of effort.
