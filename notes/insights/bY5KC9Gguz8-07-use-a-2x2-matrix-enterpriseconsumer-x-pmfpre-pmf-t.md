Your community strategy should differ based on where you are on two axes: enterprise vs. consumer focus, and whether you have [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]]. For example, pre-PMF enterprise products benefit from customer advisory boards, while post-PMF consumer products excel with ambassador and influencer programs.
