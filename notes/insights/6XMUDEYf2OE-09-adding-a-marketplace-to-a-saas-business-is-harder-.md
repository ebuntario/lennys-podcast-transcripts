Transitioning from SaaS to a marketplace is difficult because it requires building a totally new skill set (driving demand) and a relationship with your customer's customer. It's more replicable for a marketplace to add a SaaS component as a customer acquisition or retention tool. For a SaaS-to-marketplace transition to work, you need a direct relationship with your customer's customer and those end-users must need discovery across multiple suppliers.
