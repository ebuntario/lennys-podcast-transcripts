When building an [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agent]], focus on how the tool makes the human feel maximally accelerated and empowered, not just on automating tasks. For example, if an agent writes code, the human is often left with the less enjoyable task of reviewing it. The product should therefore invest in features that build confidence in the AI's work (like AI-powered code review) and present outputs in the most empowering way (showing a preview before a code diff).
