Avoid overly hierarchical titles early on to signal a culture where expertise, not authority, drives decisions. Using flexible titles like "Head of" or "Growth Lead" maintains [[concepts/company-culture|cultural]] principles of mutual ownership and provides [[concepts/hiring|hiring]] optionality as roles evolve. It also prevents the incongruity of having numerous VPs at a very small company and allows for creative scope representation when dealing with larger clients.
