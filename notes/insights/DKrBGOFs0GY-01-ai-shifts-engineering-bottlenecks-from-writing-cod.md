When AI writes most of the code, the primary bottlenecks shift upstream to decision-making, alignment, and downstream to deployment processes like the merge queue. Teams must provide a [[concepts/minimum-viable-strategy|minimum viable strategy]] to empower rapid building and then manage the "air traffic control" of landing changes. This reveals new critical paths in the development lifecycle that require re-architecting team workflows and infrastructure.
