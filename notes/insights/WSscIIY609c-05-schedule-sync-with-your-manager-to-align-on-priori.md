Instead of saying "no" to your manager, show them your timeboxed calendar and list of their requests, then ask for help prioritizing. This [[concepts/schedule-syncing|schedule syncing]] process turns prioritization into a collaborative discussion and demonstrates how you're allocating your time. It builds trust and ensures you're working on what matters most.
