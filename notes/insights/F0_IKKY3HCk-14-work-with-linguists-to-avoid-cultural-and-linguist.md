Linguistic analysis is essential for avoiding names with negative connotations, cultural sensitivities, or unintended meanings in different languages and regions. Professional linguists can identify issues that native speakers might miss, such as references to local disasters, political implications, or subtle sexual connotations. This due diligence prevents costly rebrands and ensures global viability.
