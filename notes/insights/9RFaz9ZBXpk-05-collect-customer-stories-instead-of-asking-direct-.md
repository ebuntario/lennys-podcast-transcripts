Ask "Tell me about the last time you..." to collect specific stories rather than asking direct, out-of-context questions. Stories reveal actual behavior, context, and unmet needs that customers might not even be aware of. This approach grounds insights in real experiences, making them more reliable than answers to hypothetical questions about preferences or opinions.
