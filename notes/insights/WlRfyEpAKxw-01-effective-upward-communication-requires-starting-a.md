When communicating with executives, product managers should avoid starting their story at chapter six (deep in the weeds) or at the very beginning (re-explaining basics). Instead, they must find the last point that would be obvious to the executive and build the narrative from there, ensuring clarity and earning the right to present new information. This structured [[concepts/storytelling|storytelling]] approach prevents misunderstandings and builds executive confidence in the team's strategic thinking.
