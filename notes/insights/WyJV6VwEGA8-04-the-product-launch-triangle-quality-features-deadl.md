For a new product launch, you have three variables: quality, features, and deadline, and you must choose two. The advantage of software is that you can iterate post-launch, so you might initially sacrifice quality for features and speed, then improve it over time. However, you should always aim for a "minimally awesome product" that meets a core [[concepts/quality-bar|quality bar]] for the features you do ship.
