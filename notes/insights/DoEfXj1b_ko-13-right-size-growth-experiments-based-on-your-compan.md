Avoid blindly copying growth experiments from large, scaled companies. Early-stage startups should focus on bigger, hypothesis-driven bets that can move the needle, not micro-optimizations that only matter at massive scale. Conversely, avoid launching large, complex changes without a clear hypothesis, as failure becomes uninterpretable. Base experiments on your own data and user research, not just industry best practices.
