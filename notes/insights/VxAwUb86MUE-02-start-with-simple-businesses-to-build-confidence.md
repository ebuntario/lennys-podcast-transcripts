First-time entrepreneurs should avoid complex, highly competitive ventures and instead start with simple, service-based businesses to achieve an early win. This builds a positive narrative and confidence, much like starting with light weights at the gym before attempting a heavy deadlift. An initial success provides the psychological foundation and capital to weather subsequent failures in more ambitious projects.
