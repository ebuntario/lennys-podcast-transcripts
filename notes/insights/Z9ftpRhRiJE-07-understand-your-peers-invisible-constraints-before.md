Many conflicts between product and engineering arise from invisible constraints, such as an engineering manager needing to provide interesting work for their team. Before attempting to solve a disagreement, invest time to deeply understand what the other person truly needs. Often, a compromise exists that satisfies both parties once the underlying constraints are revealed.
