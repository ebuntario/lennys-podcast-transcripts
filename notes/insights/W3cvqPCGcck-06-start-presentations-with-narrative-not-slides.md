When preparing a talk, begin by crafting your core narrative and story points before opening your slide deck. This prevents you from getting stuck in "presentation mode" and forcing your story to fit pre-made slides. A strong, logical [[concepts/storytelling|story]] should drive the creation of supporting visuals, not the other way around.
