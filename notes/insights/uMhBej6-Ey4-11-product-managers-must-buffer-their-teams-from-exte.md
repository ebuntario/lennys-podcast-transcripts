A key [[concepts/product-leadership|product leadership]] role is to buffer the team from external extremes—whether excessive praise or harsh criticism. When things go well, bring the team back to reality to maintain focus; when negative press mounts, provide perspective and keep the team charging forward. The leader's role is to filter noise, identify valid criticism, and keep the team focused on solving real customer problems.
