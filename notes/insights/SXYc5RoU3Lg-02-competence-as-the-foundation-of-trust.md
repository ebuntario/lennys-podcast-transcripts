Trust in a product manager is earned through demonstrated [[concepts/competence|competence]] in understanding the customer, the business, and the data. When others perceive you as the expert in these areas, they naturally defer to your judgment. Dislike for product managers often stems from experiences with individuals who lack this foundational expertise and therefore cannot deliver desired outcomes.
