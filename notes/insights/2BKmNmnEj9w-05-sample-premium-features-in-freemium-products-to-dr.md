In a [[concepts/freemium-model|freemium model]], interspersing samples of paid suggestions to free users can reshape their perception of the product's value. At Grammarly, showing free users a limited taste of premium features (like tone improvement) made the tool seem more powerful, nearly doubling upgrade rates. The free product should reflect the full potential of what you offer.
