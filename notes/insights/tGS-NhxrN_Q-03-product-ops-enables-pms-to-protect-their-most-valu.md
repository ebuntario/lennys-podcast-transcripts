A primary value proposition of [[concepts/product-operations|product operations]] is freeing product managers from administrative and coordination tasks that distract from core responsibilities. This allows PMs to dedicate their most valuable asset—time—to understanding customer pain points and collaborating closely with engineering teams. The role essentially acts as a filter for organizational noise, enabling PMs to focus on driving customer outcomes.
