If speaking feels unenjoyable, it's a sign you are overthinking and not doing it correctly. Speaking should feel rewarding and natural, as it does in comfortable conversations with friends or family. Structuring practice to be enjoyable ensures you stay motivated and internalize skills, much like a sustainable fitness journey.
