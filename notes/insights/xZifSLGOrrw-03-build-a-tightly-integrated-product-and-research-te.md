Creating a tightly integrated product and research team that iterates on the model, the API, and the application harness together enables faster experimentation and development. This structure allows you to ship features that require coordination across all three layers, such as enabling an agent to work continuously beyond its context window. This integrated approach is a major accelerant for building capable [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agents]].
