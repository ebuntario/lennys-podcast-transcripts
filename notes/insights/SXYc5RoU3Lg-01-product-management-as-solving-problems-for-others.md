The real essence of product management is waking up on behalf of someone else to solve a problem for them, and doing it well enough that they give you something back in return. This exchange is a certificate of appreciation, which can take the form of revenue, engagement, loyalty, or a reference. If the work isn't both fun and challenging, you're likely not doing it right.
