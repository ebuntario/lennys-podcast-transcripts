The most promising area for AI startups is the applied AI market, where companies build [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agents]] to accomplish specific jobs (e.g., customer service, legal review). This market will evolve like SaaS, with a long tail of specialized, high-margin companies focused on business outcomes. Over time, the underlying agent technology will become a commodity, and competition will shift to product differentiation, workflows, and the specific value delivered.
