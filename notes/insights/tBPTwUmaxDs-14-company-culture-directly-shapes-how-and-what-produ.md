A company's [[concepts/product-culture|product culture]]—its norms and beliefs about work—dictates product evolution, from allowing debates that change core tenets to enabling regional adaptation. Culture is always evolving; if not intentionally shaped, it will change in ways that may not serve the product or company. The behaviors you reward and condone define this culture.
