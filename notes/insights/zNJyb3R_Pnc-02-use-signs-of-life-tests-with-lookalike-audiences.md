Begin testing a new platform by uploading your existing customer data to build lookalike audiences. Start with a tight 1% lookalike, as it's highly correlated to your best customers, and run a small budget test to see if there's a "sign of life." This low-risk approach validates whether a channel has potential before you invest in building full campaigns.
