When making difficult people decisions, first determine the right choice for the core stakeholder (usually the customer). Then, separately design an [[concepts/implementation|implementation]] plan that addresses the pain points for all other affected parties. For example, when letting someone go, the decision serves the customer, but the implementation involves helping the employee find a better-fitting role.
