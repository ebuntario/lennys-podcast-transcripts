As AI agents handle more tasks, the traditional org chart evolves into a dynamic [[concepts/work-chart|work chart]] focused on tasks and throughput rather than reporting layers. Humans will decide what problems to solve, while agents execute, requiring new alignment mechanisms beyond hierarchy. This structure enables exponential productivity as the marginal cost of good output approaches zero.
