The most effective way to stop [[concepts/churn|churn]] is proactively, not reactively. Analyze your existing customer data to identify the characteristics of customers who stay the longest. Then, focus your acquisition efforts and tailor your messaging to attract more of that profile. This is more effective than trying to save customers who have already decided to leave.
