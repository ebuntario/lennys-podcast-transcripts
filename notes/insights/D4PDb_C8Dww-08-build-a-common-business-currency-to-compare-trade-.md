Quantify different business levers (e.g., price changes, delivery time improvements, new restaurant acquisition) in terms of a common currency like Gross Order Value (GOV). This creates a [[concepts/decision-making|decision framework]] that allows teams to compare trade-offs objectively and decide where to invest a dollar or a team's time for maximum impact.
