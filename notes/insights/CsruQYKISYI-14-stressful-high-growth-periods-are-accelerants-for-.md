While intensely stressful, navigating periods of extreme uncertainty and hyper-growth (like a 40x surge) provides unparalleled rates of learning and personal growth. Reframing the experience by looking ahead to what you'll have accomplished and learned years later can provide perspective. These crucible moments often forge the strongest professional relationships and skills.
