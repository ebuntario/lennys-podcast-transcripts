Decide early if pursuing a C-level role aligns with your core identity. If work is a huge part of what energizes and defines you, the path will be fulfilling. If your identity and meaning are derived more from family, community, or hobbies, you can build an incredible career without aiming for the top, leading to a more holistic and balanced life.
