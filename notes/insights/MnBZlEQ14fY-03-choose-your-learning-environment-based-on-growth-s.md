Your learning accelerates fastest on the "fastest ship" aligned with your goals. Startups teach getting started (0 to 1), while large companies teach scaling systems (1 to beyond). Understand whether you thrive in environments of process or ambiguity, and optimize for the type of learning—starter, scaler, or hypergrowth—that matches your career stage.
