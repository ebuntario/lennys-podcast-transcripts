For a company's values to be trustworthy, they must be encoded into its [[concepts/corporate-governance|governance]] structure, not reliant on any single individual. Structures like foundation-controlled companies, mission-pledged boards, or "spiritual holding companies" can ensure promises are kept even if founders leave. This makes the company's commitment to [[concepts/long-term-thinking|long-term thinking]] and stakeholder welfare a durable feature, not a temporary accident.
