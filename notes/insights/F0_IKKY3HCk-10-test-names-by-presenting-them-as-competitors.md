Instead of asking "What do you think of this name?" which triggers evaluation, ask "What if a competitor launched with this name?" This reframing encourages people to imagine what the name could do rather than judge it. The ideal response indicates the name creates a predisposition to consider the product because "they're not like the other guys."
