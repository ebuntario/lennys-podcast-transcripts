The Jobs to be Done framework is particularly valuable in businesses where the product team are not frequent users of their own service, such as in real estate where transactions happen every few years. It forces teams to be intentional and empathetic about the customer's context and the broader journey they are on. Implementing [[concepts/jobs-to-be-done]] culturally helps avoid solutions that are overly influenced by internal business goals instead of real user needs.
