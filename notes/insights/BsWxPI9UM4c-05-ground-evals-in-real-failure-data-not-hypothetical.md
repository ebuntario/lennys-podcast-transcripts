Your [[concepts/ai-evals|eval prompts]] should be derived from actual errors observed in your application data, not from a pre-written product requirements document. You often cannot anticipate the specific failure modes (like awkward handoffs or formatting issues) until you see the AI interacting with real users, which makes this grounding essential.
