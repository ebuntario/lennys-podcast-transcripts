A highly effective screening question for product roles is "Tell me about a product you love." Using the word "love" deliberately surfaces personal passion and engagement. Follow-up questions (Why do you love it? What would you build next? How would you measure it?) allow the interviewer to deeply assess the candidate's [[concepts/product-sense|product sense]], reasoning, and ability to think from a user's perspective.
