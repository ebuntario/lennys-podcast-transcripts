Before brainstorming names, create a naming brief that defines what you are naming, what you want the name to communicate, and what to avoid. This brief should include seven universal criteria: trademark availability, domain availability, distinctiveness, timelessness, alignment with key messaging, sound/ease of pronunciation, and visual appearance. This framework ensures the name supports your [[concepts/positioning|product positioning]] and long-term goals.
