Approximately 75% of freemium users are unaware of what a product is selling, making [[concepts/monetization-awareness]] the dominant pillar of free-to-paid conversion. Product teams should ensure paid functionality is visible across all user states (free, lower-tier, target) during design reviews. Tracking pricing page views per activated account and running qualitative surveys about paid plan awareness are effective ways to measure and improve this critical metric.
