Inside rapidly scaling companies, you must learn to give away tasks and responsibilities you've mastered ("your Legos") to move on to new, larger challenges. This [[concepts/letting-go|letting go]] is essential because the company's growth creates ever-larger opportunities, and clinging to past work buries you under an expanding pile. The emotional resistance is normal, but embracing this cycle is the path to building "entire worlds" instead of just "houses."
