Six weeks is a practical maximum for a [[concepts/timeboxing|time box]] because it's long enough to build something substantial but short enough to foresee major complexities and unknowns. This constraint forces teams to shape projects into chunks where the finish line is visible from the start, preventing endless "sprint extensions" and maintaining a sense of urgency and completion.
