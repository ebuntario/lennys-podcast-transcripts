Placing a generalist to lead a specialized team can unlock 10x outcomes because they are not bound by "the way things have always been done." Their value comes from hiring true subject matter experts, getting out of their way, and providing a fresh perspective that can reinvent systems, rather than seeking incremental improvement.
