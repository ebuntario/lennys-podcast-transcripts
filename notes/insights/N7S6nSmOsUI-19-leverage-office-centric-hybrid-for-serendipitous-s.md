An office-centric hybrid model (e.g., in-office Monday, Tuesday, Thursday) is designed to maximize the benefits of in-person collaboration. The key value is enabling serendipitous, high-bandwidth conversations about strategy and learning that are difficult to schedule formally. This intentional [[concepts/team-collaboration|collaboration]] structure, combined with focused remote days for deep work, can enhance both team cohesion and individual productivity.
