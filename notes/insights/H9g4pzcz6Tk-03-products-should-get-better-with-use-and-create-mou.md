A product becomes retentive when it improves with each use and creates a [[concepts/switching-costs|mounting loss]] for the user if they leave. For example, Pinterest's recommendations improve as you pin more, and Evernote becomes more valuable as you store more notes. Designing for this accruing benefit and mounting loss is key to building a product that users stick with over time.
