When presenting names internally, create prototypes that show the name in action—on T-shirts, in mock ads, or with imagery that brings the concept to life. This helps stakeholders move beyond evaluating words to imagining experiences. For bold names that might initially cause discomfort, prototypes demonstrate executional possibilities and build confidence in the name's market potential.
