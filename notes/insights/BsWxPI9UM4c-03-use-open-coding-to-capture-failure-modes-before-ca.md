When reviewing traces, practice [[concepts/qualitative-analysis|open coding]]: write a simple, descriptive note for the first obvious error you see in each interaction. Avoid trying to catalog every issue or using vague terms like "janky." The goal is to capture raw observations before later synthesizing them into categorized failure modes.
