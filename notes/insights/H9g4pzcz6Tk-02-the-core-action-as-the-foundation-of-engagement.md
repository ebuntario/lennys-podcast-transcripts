For a consumer product, the [[concepts/core-action|core action]] is the foundational behavior that indicates a user understands and derives utility from the product. This action, like pinning on Pinterest or subscribing on YouTube, should be the primary metric for measuring engaged users, not vanity metrics like MAUs. Optimizing the new user experience and product roadmap to drive this action is critical for establishing a solid foundation.
