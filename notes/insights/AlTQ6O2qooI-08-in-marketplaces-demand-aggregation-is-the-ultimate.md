While early-stage marketplaces must focus on supply, the long-term winning strategy is to aggregate demand. If you can reliably deliver customers to suppliers at a profitable rate, suppliers will always say yes. Therefore, when making trade-offs, always optimize for the customer (demand-side) experience, as demand is the fundamental currency that powers the entire [[concepts/marketplace-strategy|marketplace]] ecosystem.
