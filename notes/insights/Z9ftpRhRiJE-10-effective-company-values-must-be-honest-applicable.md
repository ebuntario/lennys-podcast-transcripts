Good [[concepts/company-culture|company values]] are honest (they reflect actual behavior), applicable (they guide concrete decisions), and reversible (you can imagine a company legitimately choosing the opposite). Avoid "identity values" like "we care about customers" that no company would dispute. Values should help teams navigate real trade-offs, not just sound aspirational.
