When delivering feedback, structure it as: the situation (e.g., "In Tuesday's 3 PM meeting"), the observable behavior (e.g., "you interrupted me"), and the impact it had on you (e.g., "it made me feel my point wasn't heard"). This model frames feedback as your subjective experience, which is inherently true and less likely to be debated. It focuses the conversation on the impact of actions, not on being right, which is crucial for [[concepts/management|management]] and growth.
