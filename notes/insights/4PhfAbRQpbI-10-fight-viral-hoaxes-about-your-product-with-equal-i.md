When a viral hoax threatens your product (e.g., false claims of danger), you must fight it with relentless, multi-vector intensity. This includes securing retractions from authorities, influencing search results, creating counter-content, and even platform-level takedowns. The key is ensuring the hoax is less viral than your app; treat it as an existential threat requiring full mobilization.
