A sharp problem is one that materially steals a customer's time, energy, or money. To test if a problem is sharp enough, map the customer's current workflow and then map it again using your solution; look for a 2-3X shortening of the process. Signs you're on the right track include prospects' eyes widening ("whites of their eyes") and them spontaneously asking when they can pay.
