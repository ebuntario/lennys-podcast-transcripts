Send a pre-read with a clear agenda 24 hours before a meeting, and cancel if it's not reviewed. During the meeting, use a shared visual to anchor discussion and real-time edit decisions and next steps. Within 24 hours after, reply-all to the calendar invite with meeting notes. This creates a [[concepts/action-accountability|closed loop]] for communication and ensures extreme clarity on outcomes.
