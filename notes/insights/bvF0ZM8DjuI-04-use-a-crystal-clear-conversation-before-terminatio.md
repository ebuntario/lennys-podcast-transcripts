Before considering termination, have a definitive conversation stating that specific, unaddressed performance issues are "deal breakers." Outline the exact changes required and a clear timeline, such as 30 days, and state the consequence of not meeting them. This creates a culture where [[concepts/performance-management|performance management]] is transparent, and any eventual termination is not a surprise, protecting both the individual's dignity and the company's operational integrity.
