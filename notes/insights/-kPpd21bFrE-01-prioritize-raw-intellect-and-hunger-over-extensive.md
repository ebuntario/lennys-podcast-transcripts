Revolut values [[concepts/raw-intellect|raw intellect]] and unquenched hunger to build things more than years of experience. They find that experienced professionals often lack the drive to change the status quo, while passionate builders with less experience thrive by attacking problems relentlessly. This approach creates a steeper learning curve and faster career acceleration for those who join.
