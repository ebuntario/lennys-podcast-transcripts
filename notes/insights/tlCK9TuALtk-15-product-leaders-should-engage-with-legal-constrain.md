Effective founders and product leaders engage deeply with legal considerations, asking questions until they understand the regulations nearly as well as the lawyers. They then apply a first-principles, product-minded approach to push the boundaries of what's possible, ensuring legal guidance is an enabler for innovation, not an overly conservative blocker.
