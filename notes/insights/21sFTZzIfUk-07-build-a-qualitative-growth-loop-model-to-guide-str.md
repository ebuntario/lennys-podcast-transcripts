Documenting your [[concepts/growth-loops|growth loops]] in a qualitative model creates a shared understanding of how you grow and is a powerful tool for guiding quarter-to-quarter focus. This model, augmented with quantitative data, helps identify the biggest constraints in your growth system, allowing you to be intentional about where to invest. In a high-performing growth team with no shortage of ideas, this model plays a critical role in knowing where to focus amidst the sea of opportunities.
