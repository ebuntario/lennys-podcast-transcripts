A powerful early [[concepts/early-stage-growth|growth strategy]] is to use your cap table strategically. By getting influential founders, operators, and advisors as investors, you can turn them into initial customers and advocates. This builds a strong reputation within a specific community and creates a base of referenceable customers, which is more impactful than investor introductions alone for driving early adoption.
