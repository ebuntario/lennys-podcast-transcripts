The fundamental job of a product manager is not execution or delivery, but finding reliable, differentiated value that can be uniquely delivered to the market. Great PMs avoid getting dragged into internal politics or scrum management, focusing instead on external perspectives. Success comes from organizing goals and resources to create dramatically more impact than an unorganized team could achieve alone, which is where the true leverage of the role lies.
