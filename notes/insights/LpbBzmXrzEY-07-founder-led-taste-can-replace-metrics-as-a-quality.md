When founders or leaders have exceptional product taste and intuition, they can replace metrics as the primary quality mechanism for core product teams. This approach enables more ambitious, forward-looking work unconstrained by short-term optimization, but requires centralized review by those with proven judgment. Without either strong metrics or strong taste leadership, teams risk building haphazardly without accountability.
