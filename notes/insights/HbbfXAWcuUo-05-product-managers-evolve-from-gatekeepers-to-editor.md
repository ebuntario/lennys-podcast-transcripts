As [[concepts/ai-democratization|AI democratizes]] prototyping and increases the supply of ideas, the product manager's role shifts from gatekeeper to essential editor and taste-maker. The bar is higher for PMs to provide editorial judgment and curate what rises above the noise, but they must now earn this authority rather than assume it based on title alone.
