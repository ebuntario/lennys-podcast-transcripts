A company's culture is shaped by the type of product it builds; a visual product company thinks and communicates visually. At Canva, ideas are conveyed through mock-ups and prototypes, not just conversation. New hires must adapt to this visual-first [[concepts/communication|communication]] style to effectively collaborate and lead.
