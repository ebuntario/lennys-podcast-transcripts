If you're not being promoted, diagnose which of these four common reasons applies: 1) Lack of advocacy (no one sees your "magic"), 2) The next role doesn't exist (common in non-hypergrowth periods), 3) Impatience (the timeline for leadership promotions is longer), or 4) A real development area that you either don't see or refuse to change. Understanding the root cause is essential for formulating the correct response, whether it's seeking new advocates, waiting, or working on [[concepts/self-awareness|self-awareness]].
