A great startup [[concepts/insight-validation|insight]] is a non-obvious truth about how inflections can change behavior. It must be both non-consensus *and* right; being right but consensus means the idea is too similar to the present and lacks radical potential. This [[concepts/non-consensus-thinking|non-consensus thinking]] is what allows a startup to force a choice, not a comparison, and attract early believers who are desperate for the solution.
