A powerful interview question for candidates to ask potential employers is, "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives you've recently personally been involved with?" This allows the candidate to test the alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working closely with. Similarly, when hiring, look for signals of humility and self-awareness by asking candidates to project where they think they need to grow personally and professionally in the next few years.
