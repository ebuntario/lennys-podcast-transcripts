When building a growth team, critically assess whether individuals can do their best work in that fast-paced, iterative environment. Developers who thrive in growth are motivated by moving quickly, creating measurable impact, are not attached to their work, embrace imperfection, and happily discard code or ideas based on learnings. In contrast, engineers who are deeply motivated by complex technical challenges and the process itself may struggle. It's a leader's role to help identify these situational factors and ensure people are in roles where they can thrive.
