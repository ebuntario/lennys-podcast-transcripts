Treat advanced AI like Claude as a [[concepts/thinking-partner|thinking partner]] to explore problem domains and generate ideas without the cost barrier of consulting an expert. This acts as an "electric bike for the mind," allowing you to cover vast intellectual ground quickly and cheaply. Use it to [[concepts/exploration|explore]] half-formed thoughts, critique concepts, and prepare for more focused expert consultations later.
