A life lived as a mountain to be climbed—constantly striving for the next peak—is exhausting and unsustainable. An alternative metaphor is to surrender and float down life's river, practicing [[concepts/surrender|surrender]] instead of fighting the current. By tuning into internal signals and relaxing into the flow, one may arrive at a destination meant for them, moving from optimization to presence.
