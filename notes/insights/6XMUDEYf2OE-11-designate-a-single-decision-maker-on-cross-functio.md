To improve execution speed and alignment, designate one person on a [[concepts/cross-functional-collaboration|cross-functional team]] as the driver or directly responsible individual (DRI). Once that person makes a call, it's "disagree and commit" time for the rest of the team, with no escalation path before shipping. This clarifies [[concepts/decision-rights|decision rights]] and allows the team to learn from outcomes quickly.
