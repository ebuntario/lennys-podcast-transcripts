When selling to pragmatists to cross the chasm, never lead with your product or demo. Instead, start by diagnosing their severe, specific problem, much like a doctor listens to a patient's symptoms. Your goal is to demonstrate deep understanding of their pain, building trust and positioning yourself as the committed problem-solver, not just a vendor.
