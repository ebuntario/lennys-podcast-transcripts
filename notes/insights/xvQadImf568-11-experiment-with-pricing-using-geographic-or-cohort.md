For PLG companies with public pricing pages, run controlled experiments on price points, value metrics, and plans. A useful tactic is to segment tests by geography (e.g., Canada or Australia first) before a broad rollout. Building or buying [[concepts/growth-infrastructure|growth infrastructure]] for pricing experimentation is a high-ROI investment.
