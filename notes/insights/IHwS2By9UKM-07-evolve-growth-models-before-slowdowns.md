Don't wait for your primary [[concepts/growth-loops|growth loop]] to plateau before exploring new models; introduce fresh approaches every 18 months. Allocate 20-25% of growth team time annually to test new channels or loops, as established engines inevitably face diminishing returns. Layer complementary models (product-led, sales-led, marketing-led) to diversify and sustain growth.
