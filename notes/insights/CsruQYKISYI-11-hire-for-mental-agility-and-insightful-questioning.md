When hiring product managers, design interviews to test how candidates react when core assumptions change mid-problem, revealing mental agility. Also, pay close attention to the quality and insightfulness of the questions candidates ask you; this signals deep curiosity, preparation, and the ability to think critically about the business beyond the immediate role.
