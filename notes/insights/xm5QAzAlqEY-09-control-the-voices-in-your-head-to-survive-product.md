Product leadership involves constant ambiguity where every path has flaws. The existential challenge is that if you don't control the critical [[concepts/self-talk|voices in your head]], they will "eat you alive." Recognize that the existence of potential criticism does not equate to valid failure. Developing mental discipline to manage this internal narrative is non-negotiable for longevity in the role.
