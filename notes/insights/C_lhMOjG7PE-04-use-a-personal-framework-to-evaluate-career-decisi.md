Create a written framework of what you truly value in work—such as learning, impact, and working with smart people—to filter career opportunities objectively. This prevents distraction by shiny titles or compensation that don't align with your core priorities. When your framework is violated, have the conviction to make changes, even resigning if necessary, to stay true to your [[concepts/career-development|growth path]].
