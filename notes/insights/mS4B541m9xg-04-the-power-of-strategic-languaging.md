Creating new language is a powerful tool for [[concepts/category-design|category design]] because it changes how people think and perceive value. For instance, Starbucks didn't just sell expensive coffee; it created new languaging like "vente" and "grande latte" to differentiate itself and justify a higher price point. The company that creates and owns the language for a category wins, as it builds new mental scaffolding that makes their innovation understandable and desirable.
