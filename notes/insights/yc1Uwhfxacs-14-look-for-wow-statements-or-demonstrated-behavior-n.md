During customer discovery, treat polite responses like "that sounds interesting" as a "no." High-signal positive indicators are "wow statements" expressing clear, excited need ("I'd pay a lot for that!") or demonstrated behaviors like requesting a follow-up meeting, asking for a deck to share with colleagues, or inquiring about a waitlist. These actions reveal genuine demand.
