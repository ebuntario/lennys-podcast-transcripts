Follow a pattern of incubate, iterate, then integrate. Initially build a detached experience to freely reimagine the UX for a new audience without being constrained by the existing platform's norms. Once the solution is validated, then work on [[concepts/platform-integration|integrating it back]] into the core product. This avoids prematurely bogging down innovation with platform requirements and technical debt discussions.
