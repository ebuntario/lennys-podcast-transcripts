A common mistake is starting strategic planning with goals (e.g., "increase revenue by X%"). Instead, goals should come after defining the strategy and roadmap, acting as a measure of progress toward a strategic destination. This prevents teams from pursuing goal-oriented work that may pull them away from their core [[concepts/strategic-alignment|strategic direction]].
