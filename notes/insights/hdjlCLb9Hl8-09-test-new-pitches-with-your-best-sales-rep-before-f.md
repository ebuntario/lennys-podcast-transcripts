Implement new sales pitches by first training your top performer and having them test with qualified prospects. After each pitch, gather feedback and iterate on what works and what doesn't. Once the rep confirms the new pitch outperforms the old one, use them to evangelize it to the rest of the sales team through peer-led training.
