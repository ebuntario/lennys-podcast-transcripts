Building a startup is like drug discovery: the market either has the "binding receptors" for your product or it doesn't. No amount of marketing or launch hype can create demand where none exists. This mindset is liberating—it forces founders to focus on finding the right "drug" (product) for an existing market need, rather than trying to convince the market to want something it doesn't.
