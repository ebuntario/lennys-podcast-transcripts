A true product manager is a creator, not just a facilitator or project manager. Their core responsibility is ensuring a solution is both valuable to the customer and viable for the business, which requires deep expertise in users, data, market, and business constraints like sales, marketing, and compliance. This contrasts with roles focused solely on backlog administration or project coordination.
