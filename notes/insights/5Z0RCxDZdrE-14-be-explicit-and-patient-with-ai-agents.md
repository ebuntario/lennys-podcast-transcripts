When using AI agents, start with small, explicit instructions to avoid large, incorrect changes. Users develop an intuition for the "hills and valleys" of the product—knowing what it's good at and when to be cautious. This learned patience, similar to using autocomplete, is key to unlocking high productivity with generative tools.
