A good [[concepts/north-star-metric|North Star Metric]] is a leading indicator that reflects units of value delivered to the customer (e.g., nights booked, files synced). It should be "up and to the right" over time and correlate with revenue growth, but revenue itself should not be the metric. Focusing the team on growing customer value aligns incentives better than focusing directly on business outcomes.
