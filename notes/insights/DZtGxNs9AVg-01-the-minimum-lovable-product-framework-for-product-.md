The goal is to build a [[concepts/minimum-lovable-product|minimum lovable product]] first, then a lovable product, and finally an absolutely lovable product. This progression emphasizes creating something users genuinely love from the start, rather than just a minimal viable version. The company name "Lovable" itself reflects this core philosophy of prioritizing user delight over mere functionality.
