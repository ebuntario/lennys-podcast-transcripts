Personify the fear, territorialism, and insecurity that arise during [[concepts/organizational-change|organizational change]] as a separate entity (e.g., "Bob"). This monster's job is to make you the worst version of yourself, but your job is to acknowledge its presence without acting on its impulses. Emotions like feeling like an imposter or wanting to send a rage email are normal waves; pay attention only if they persist beyond two weeks, as short-term reactions are not a useful compass.
