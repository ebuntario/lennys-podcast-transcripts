When working on important opportunities, develop and test multiple solutions simultaneously to compare their pros and cons. Just as you wouldn't choose a home after seeing only one option, evaluating several solutions leads to better product decisions. This practice prevents teams from overcommitting to the first idea that comes to mind.
