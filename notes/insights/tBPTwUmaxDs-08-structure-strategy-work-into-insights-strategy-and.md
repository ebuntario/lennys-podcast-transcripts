A robust [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]] process has three phases: an insights day to deeply understand problems, a strategy day to decide focus areas, and a big rocks day to identify the 3-5 major initiatives. This narrative structure (insights, strategy, big rocks) creates a clear, evergreen document that explains why you exist, how you'll win, and what you'll deliver.
