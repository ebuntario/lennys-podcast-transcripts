Treat the company as a dehydrated entity where each hire is a bit of water. Only hire when a team is genuinely underwater and raising their hand for help. This forces [[concepts/ruthless-prioritization|ruthless prioritization]] and prevents people from manufacturing unnecessary work, keeping the organization lean and focused on what truly matters.
