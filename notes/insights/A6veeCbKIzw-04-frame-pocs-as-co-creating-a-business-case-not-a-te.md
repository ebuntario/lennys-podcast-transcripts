The entire goal of a POC should be to co-create a business case and ROI model with the customer, not just to demonstrate technical functionality. Co-create the model's inputs (e.g., time saved, headcount reduced) during the POC so the customer validates the assumptions. This transforms the POC from a feature test into a foundation for [[concepts/commercial-discussions|commercial discussions]].
