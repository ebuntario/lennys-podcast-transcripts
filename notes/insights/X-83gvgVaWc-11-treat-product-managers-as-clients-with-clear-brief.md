To make the design process efficient, product managers should act as good clients by providing a clear, specific [[concepts/creative-brief|creative brief]]. Ambiguous inputs force designers to "wring out" the ambiguity to produce the specific output engineering needs. The more context and constraints (like the desired emotional response) provided upfront, the faster and more effectively design can operate within the right "basketball court" of possibilities.
