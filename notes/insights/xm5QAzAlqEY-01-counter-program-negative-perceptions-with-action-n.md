When you're worried someone has a negative impression of you, avoid litigating the past or trying to directly change their mind. Instead, ask: "What is one small action I can take to demonstrate the opposite of what I'm afraid they think?" This [[concepts/behavioral-change|behavioral activation]] shifts focus from unproductive rumination to constructive agency, proving your character through future behavior rather than defending past actions.
