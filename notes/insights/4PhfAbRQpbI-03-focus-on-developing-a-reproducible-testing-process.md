The unpredictability of consumer products means you should focus more on your [[concepts/product-development-process|process for testing]] than on any single idea. A reproducible process for taking many shots reduces risk more than anything. Compartmentalize validation by focusing 100% on one hypothesis at a time (e.g., core usage, then virality) to get clear signal.
