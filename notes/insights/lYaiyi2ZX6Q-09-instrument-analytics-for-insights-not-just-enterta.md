Effective [[concepts/data-instrumentation|data instrumentation]] tracks rich event properties (like number of drivers on screen or basket value) to generate actionable insights, not just surface-level observations. An insight explains *why* a behavior occurs and dictates a change in action, whereas a mere measurement does not. Teams should design tracking to answer causal questions and test hypotheses.
