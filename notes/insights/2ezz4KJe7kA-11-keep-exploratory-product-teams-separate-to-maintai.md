When incubating new products, consider running them as separate teams, distinct from the core product organization. This separation prevents them from being bogged down by the operational burdens (bugs, tech debt, processes) of the established product. It allows for faster movement, independent strategic thinking, and clearer identification of a potentially different target customer, though it requires later investment in integration.
