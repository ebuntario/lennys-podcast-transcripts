When users complain about missing features or shortcomings in a minimal product, it's a strong positive signal. It means they care enough to provide feedback and are engaging with the core value. If nobody complains, it can be a red flag indicating lack of engagement. This feedback directly informs the next week's priorities for iteration and expansion.
