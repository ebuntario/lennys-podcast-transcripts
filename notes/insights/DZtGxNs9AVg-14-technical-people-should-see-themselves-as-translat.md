As AI handles more implementation, technical professionals should reframe their role as translators who understand both human problems and technical constraints. Rather than focusing on specific tech stacks, they need to abstract up several levels to bridge the gap between stated needs and feasible solutions. This translation skill becomes more valuable than pure coding ability.
