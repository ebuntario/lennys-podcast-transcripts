A common form of [[concepts/bad-strategy|bad strategy]] is a list of performance goals or ambitions, like "grow faster" or "increase profit," without a plan to achieve them. Another hallmark is [[concepts/fluff|fluff]]—using abstract, buzzword-laden language that sounds strategic but lacks substance. True strategy requires a diagnosis and actionable steps, not just a statement of desired outcomes.
