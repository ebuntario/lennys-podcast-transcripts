When launching features that affect user control or policies, invest in elaborate, considerate rollout strategies. For example, Slack's Do Not Disturb launch involved pre-announcements to admins, sensible organization-level defaults, and clear, layered override permissions for both admins and users. This prevents conflict, respects existing setups, and ensures adoption without forcing disruptive change.
