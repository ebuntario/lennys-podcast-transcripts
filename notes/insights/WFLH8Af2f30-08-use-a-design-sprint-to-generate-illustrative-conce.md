After defining strategic pillars, run a [[concepts/design-sprint|design sprint]] led by design to create illustrative concepts (not feature-ready designs) that bring each pillar to life. These concepts, framed as "how might we" questions, make the strategy tangible and easier for others to understand, bridging the gap between strategy words and eventual features.
