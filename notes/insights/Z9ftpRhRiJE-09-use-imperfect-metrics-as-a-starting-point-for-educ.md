When reporting on engineering, start with measurable [[concepts/success-metrics|metrics]] (like DORA metrics) even if they are imperfect. These metrics serve as a conversation starter to educate stakeholders about the nuances and complexities of engineering work. The goal is to build a shared understanding, not to present a flawless dashboard.
