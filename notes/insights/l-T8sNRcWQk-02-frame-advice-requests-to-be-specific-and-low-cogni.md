When seeking advice, avoid vague questions like "what should I do with my career?" Instead, present a specific scenario with your current plan to anchor the discussion. This reduces cognitive load for the advisor and yields richer, more actionable feedback. Always explain why you chose that person to ask, as it makes them feel valued and increases the likelihood of a thoughtful response.
