A [[concepts/curiosity-loop|curiosity loop]] is a structured method for gathering contextual advice by asking a specific, unbiased question to a curated group. This approach fights the problem of bad advice by making input more relevant to your situation, unlike vague questions that yield unhelpful responses. Design the ask to be lightweight—like picking top choices from a list—to increase response rates and respect people's time.
