You must understand the performance of your [[concepts/machine-learning|machine learning]] system to design an appropriate user interface. If your algorithm has a one-in-five hit rate, showing a single play button will fail; instead, design a UI that shows multiple options simultaneously. Always include an easy [[concepts/fault-tolerance|escape hatch]] so users can correct wrong predictions without friction.
