Companies with free users or long-tail communities need a "VP of Free"—someone who champions the value of the non-paying users. Growth teams focus on conversion, and sales teams focus on monetization, but the founder and product must advocate for the vast majority who may never pay but are vital for community, advocacy, and network effects. This role ensures the product remains customer-centric.
