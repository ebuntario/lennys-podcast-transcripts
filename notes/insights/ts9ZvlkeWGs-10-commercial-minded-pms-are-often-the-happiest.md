Paradoxically, product managers who deeply understand their business model and focus on commercial impact report higher job satisfaction. They are not constantly fighting their company to "do product the right way" but instead work *with* the company's realities to drive success. This alignment reduces internal conflict, provides clear direction for discovery and validation work, and allows them to detach more easily after work, knowing they've contributed to what the business truly values.
