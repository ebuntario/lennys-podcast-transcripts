While [[concepts/product-dogfooding|dogfooding]] your own product is valuable for identifying potential issues, it is insufficient for prioritization and understanding real user problems. Product builders have different contexts, priorities, and expertise than their users, which creates blind spots. Researchers are needed to provide the [[concepts/context-of-use|context of use]] and determine which issues actually matter to the target audience.
