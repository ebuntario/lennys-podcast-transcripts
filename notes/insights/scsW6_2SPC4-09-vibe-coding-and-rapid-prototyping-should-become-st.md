AI coding tools enable "vibe coding," where developers guide models to rapidly build functional prototypes through conversational prompts. This should replace static mockups for exploring ideas, allowing teams to create and test working proofs of concept in minutes. Embracing this [[concepts/ai-assisted-development|AI-assisted workflow]] accelerates innovation and brings product concepts to life much faster.
