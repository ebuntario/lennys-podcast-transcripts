Instead of over-analyzing a career spreadsheet, "put on the coat of the job" and assess the emotional fit. Ask if you'd feel lucky to be there, if you trust the people, and if the environment fosters creativity. This [[concepts/authenticity|authentic]] connection to your work is a greater predictor of success than a rigid five-year plan.
