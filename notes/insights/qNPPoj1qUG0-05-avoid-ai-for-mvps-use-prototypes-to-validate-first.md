Do not use AI for a [[concepts/minimum-viable-product|minimum viable product (MVP)]]; it's a waste of resources. Instead, create a Figma prototype to fake the AI functionality and validate the idea with users. Use AI only when you have sufficient data or can leverage adjacent data to build a meaningful, scalable solution.
