When time is pressured, the common mistake is to cut quality. The correct method is to cut scope aggressively. Examine every element and ask, "If we remove this, is the product still useful?" Repeat until the product would be useless with one more cut. This preserves a quality bar where the feature works for the user while enabling a fast [[concepts/shipping-cadence|shipping cadence]] to validate core value.
