Define your end goal (e.g., "perform on all major platforms") and work backwards to identify milestones. This approach informs hiring and resource planning, such as knowing when to bring a creative person in-house after scaling spend with an agency. It creates a clear [[concepts/scenario-planning|roadmap]] for growth and prevents reactive, bloated hiring.
