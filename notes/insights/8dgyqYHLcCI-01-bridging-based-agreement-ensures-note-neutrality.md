The core [[concepts/algorithm-design|algorithm]] for Community Notes doesn't rely on simple majority votes, which could amplify bias. Instead, it looks for agreement from people who have historically disagreed on other topics. This "bridging-based agreement" is what makes notes neutral, accurate, and resistant to manipulation by polarized groups.
