A core definition of product management is facilitating a [[concepts/value-creation|value exchange]] between a business and its customers. The specific nature of this exchange depends on the business model (B2B/B2C, funding, etc.). Successful PMs are intensely curious about what success means for *their specific business*—whether it's runway for a startup, shareholder promises for a public company, or regulatory compliance—and align their team's work to that definition.
