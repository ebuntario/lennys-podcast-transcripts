To evaluate a potential [[concepts/inflections|inflection]], ask three stress-test questions: 1) What is the specific new thing that was just introduced? 2) What specific form of empowerment does it offer, and to whom? 3) Under what conditions will that empowerment be realized (and not blocked by regulation, customer rejection, etc.)? This framework moves beyond vague "why now" statements to a concrete analysis of the turning point's power.
