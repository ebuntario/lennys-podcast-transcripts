To speed up product development, get aggressive about clarifying who is responsible for reviewing and approving work. Implement rules like having only one blocking approver per stage and limiting the number of reviews per piece of work. Also, cap meeting attendees and require hosts to write better decision notes if too many people are invited. This reduces bureaucratic drag and creates clear agency, significantly improving [[concepts/operational-efficiency|operational efficiency]].
