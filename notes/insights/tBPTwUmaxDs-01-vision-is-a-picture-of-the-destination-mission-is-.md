A compelling [[concepts/product-vision|product vision]] is a picture of the future state, like describing the view from the summit of a mountain. In contrast, the mission is the purpose of why you undertake the journey and the guiding principles for how you'll achieve it. This distinction provides clarity for aligning teams on both the destination and the reason for going.
