A key lesson is to deeply understand why users love your product and relentlessly invest in that core concept. When building adjacent products or features, leverage that core advantage instead of chasing competitive trends that dilute your focus. For example, Airbnb's strength is its unique home inventory, not operational management, which should guide where to invest.
