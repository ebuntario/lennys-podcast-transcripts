Calendly's first users were customer success agents at a company that contracted with the same Ukrainian development firm building the initial product. These agents used it to schedule calls, and their clients (parents) then adopted it, creating an organic, viral spread within a community. Combined with a free tier (initially due to lacking billing infrastructure), this created a powerful foundation for early growth.
