If an AI model is the product, then an [[concepts/ai-evals|eval]] is its product requirement document. Researchers run dozens of experiments making small improvements against an eval set, and reinforcement learning allows them to effectively climb this benchmark. This makes the creation of high-quality evals the primary bottleneck for improving model capabilities across any domain.
