The primary job of a manager is not to be the expert but to enable team members to be their best. Adopt a [[concepts/coaching|coaching]] stance of curiosity and exploration, using well-informed hypotheses rather than waiting for perfect data. For example, explore an observation by saying, "I noticed a pattern in your work; have you seen this?" This collaborative approach to [[concepts/feedback|feedback]] is more effective than directive lecturing.
