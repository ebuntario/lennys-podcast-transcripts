In an [[concepts/ai-engineering|AI-native engineering]] team, the role shifts from manually writing code to managing [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agents]] that write code. Engineers spend their time crafting precise instructions, reviewing AI-generated output, and ensuring alignment with the product vision. While foundational [[concepts/technical-skills|technical knowledge]] remains crucial for debugging and understanding system architecture, the act of hand-coding becomes increasingly rare at the frontier.
