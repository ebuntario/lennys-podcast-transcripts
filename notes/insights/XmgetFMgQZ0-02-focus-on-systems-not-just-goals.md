Goals with good intentions often fail without a supporting system. For example, a team with an OKR to talk to 10 customers may not build lasting customer instincts, whereas a team with a default-on system—like regular weekly customer sessions—develops strong intuition. Obsess over the [[concepts/systems-thinking|system]] that gets you to the goal, not just the goal itself.
