When users or employees are unhappy with a change, authentic listening and transparent explanation can transform their perspective. Direct, personal communication that acknowledges their concerns and honestly explains the reasoning builds connection and understanding. This principle of [[concepts/communication|authentic communication]] applies to product changes, leadership decisions, and even parenting.
