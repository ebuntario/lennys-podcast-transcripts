Product teams should be accountable for running [[concepts/product-experimentation|experiments]] and moving metrics, not for predicting exactly which features will succeed. Just as a sales team is funded to make calls knowing some will fail but enough will succeed, product teams should be funded to test hypotheses. Your accountability should be for the volume and quality of experiments run, not for guaranteeing specific feature delivery dates.
