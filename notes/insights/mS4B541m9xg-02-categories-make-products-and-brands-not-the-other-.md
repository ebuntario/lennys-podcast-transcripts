Legendary companies and innovators are remembered for breaking new ground, not for being the best within an established category. The category itself creates the product and the brand, establishing a new distinction in value that didn't exist before. For example, a company like Gojo didn't just make better soap; it created the new category of liquid soap and later hand sanitizer by reimagining the core problem. Success comes from designing the market category, not just fitting a product into an existing one.
