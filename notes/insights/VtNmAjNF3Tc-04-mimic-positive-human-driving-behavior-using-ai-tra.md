Autonomous vehicles can achieve natural, human-like driving by training deep learning models on vast amounts of human driving data. The key is to filter out bad driving behavior and only mimic the good. This allows the system to understand subtle cues like pedestrian body orientation and social norms, making its behavior feel familiar and safe rather than robotic.
