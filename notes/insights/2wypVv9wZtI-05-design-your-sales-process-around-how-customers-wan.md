The [[concepts/demand-side-sales|demand-side sales]] approach involves mapping the customer's [[concepts/buying-journey|buying journey]]—first thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, first use, and ongoing use—and tailoring interactions to each phase. For example, offering different types of demos (educational, comparative, decisional) based on where the customer is in their process dramatically increases conversion rates. This meets customers where they are rather than forcing them into a standardized sales funnel.
