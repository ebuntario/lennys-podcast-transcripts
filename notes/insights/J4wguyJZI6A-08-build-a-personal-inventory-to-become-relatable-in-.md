In corporate settings, strategically share personal details to become memorable and relatable, rather than being "round, white, and flavorless." Identify items from your life (e.g., being married, a runner, a parent) and find clever ways to weave them into conversations. This transforms you from a generic spokesperson into a human being people want to connect with.
