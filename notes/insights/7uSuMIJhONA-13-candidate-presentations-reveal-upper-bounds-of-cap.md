Having candidates present at the start of an interview loop allows them to "upper bound" themselves—to show what they're truly capable of when given control. What they choose to present and how they frame it reveals their priorities, communication skills, and strategic thinking. This complements other interviews that often focus on "lower bounding" for risks.
