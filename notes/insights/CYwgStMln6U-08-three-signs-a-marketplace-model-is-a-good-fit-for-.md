A [[concepts/marketplace-strategy|marketplace model]] is well-suited when there is high fragmentation on both sides (no dominant players), a relatively uniform set of needs (supply can be somewhat commoditized), and a high barrier in the current matchmaking process (it's hard for buyers and sellers to find and vet each other). These conditions indicate a clear opportunity for an aggregator to add value.
