Instead of asking "What's a great product you shipped?"—which yields a rehearsed success story—ask about a recent or random ship. This forces the candidate to discuss their framework and approach to a typical project, including how they handle ambiguity, collaboration, and less-than-ideal outcomes. You learn more about their [[concepts/product-process|operational mindset]] than their biggest win.
