A [[concepts/pre-mortem|pre-mortem]] is a meeting where a team imagines a project has already failed and works backward to identify potential causes. This ritual creates [[concepts/psychological-safety|psychological safety]] because it gives everyone license to voice concerns without being seen as negative. Teams develop a shared vocabulary (like "tigers," "paper tigers," and "elephants") to discuss threats objectively, preventing many issues that would otherwise require a painful post-mortem.
