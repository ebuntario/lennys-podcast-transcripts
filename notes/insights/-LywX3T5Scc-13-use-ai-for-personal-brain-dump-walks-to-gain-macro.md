Leverage AI as a thinking partner to gain clarity and perspective. A practical habit is an "AI walk," where you voice-record a stream of consciousness into a notes app while walking, then use AI to summarize and organize the thoughts. This process helps filter out daily noise and refocus on strategic, macro-level priorities, providing a valuable [[concepts/reflection|reflective]] vantage point.
