Saying no to opportunities presumes you already know what's on the other side of the door, which is arrogant and limiting. A [[concepts/opportunity|yes]] can always become a no later, but saying yes opens chains of unexpected opportunities and personal growth. Pursue things that scare you, as they are often the most beneficial.
