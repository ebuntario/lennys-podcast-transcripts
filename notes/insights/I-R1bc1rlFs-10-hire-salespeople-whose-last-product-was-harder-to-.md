A key heuristic for sales hires is to prioritize candidates whose previous product was slightly harder to sell than yours (e.g., more technical, more competitive, or involved a more complex business process change). They bring hardened skills and will find selling your product comparatively easier, whereas someone moving from an easier product to a harder one often struggles.
