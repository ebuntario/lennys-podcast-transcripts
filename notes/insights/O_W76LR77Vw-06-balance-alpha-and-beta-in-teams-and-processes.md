In finance, alpha is outperformance and beta is volatility; this framework applies to building teams and processes. High-alpha individuals or teams drive innovation and outsized returns, while low-beta systems provide reliability. The key is to apply [[concepts/process-design|process judiciously]] to lower beta (reduce volatility) in areas like core operations without suppressing alpha (innovation) in areas that need it.
