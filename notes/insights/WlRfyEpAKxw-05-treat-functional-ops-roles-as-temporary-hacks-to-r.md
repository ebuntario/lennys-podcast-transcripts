Operations teams (e.g., product ops, marketing ops) should exist to identify and eliminate manual processes through better [[concepts/process-automation|automation]] or software, not to become permanent fixtures. The goal is for the role to make itself obsolete by solving the underlying inefficiency. Normalizing large, permanent ops functions is a form of empire-building that institutionalizes waste rather than solving it.
