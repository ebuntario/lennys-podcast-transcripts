When building a minimum viable product, avoid constructing just a foundational piece (the axle) of a grander vision (the car). Instead, build a complete, simpler vehicle that delivers end-to-end value (the scooter). This approach ensures customers can derive full utility from a smaller, functional product slice, which can then be iteratively expanded into the more complex final vision.
