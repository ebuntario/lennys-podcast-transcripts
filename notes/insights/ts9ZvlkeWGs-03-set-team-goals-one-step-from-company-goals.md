Effective team goals should be no more than one step away from top-level company goals, avoiding cascading abstractions that lose connection to impact. For example, if the company goal is revenue growth, a team goal could be converting a specific number of single-product users to multi-product users, where the revenue impact is a simple calculation. This clarity ensures everyone understands how the team's work directly contributes to [[concepts/business-impact|business impact]] and makes prioritization decisions easier.
