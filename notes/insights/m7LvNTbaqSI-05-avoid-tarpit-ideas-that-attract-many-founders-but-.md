Tarpit ideas are startup concepts that seem promising and receive positive feedback but have historically trapped founders without leading to success. Examples include apps for coordinating social plans with friends or music discovery platforms—ideas that generate initial validation but have been attempted since the 1990s with little success. These [[concepts/startup-ideas|startup ideas]] are dangerous because they're appealing enough to draw founders in but difficult enough to create sustainable businesses.
