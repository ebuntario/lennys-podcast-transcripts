The [[concepts/disagree-and-commit|disagree and commit]] principle involves voicing contrary viewpoints with new information during decision-making. True commitment happens after leaders demonstrate they've understood and considered the disagreement. This process creates alignment based on shared understanding rather than superficial agreement, enabling teams to move forward decisively.
