[[concepts/organizational-culture|Organizational culture]] is shaped by leaders consistently living the behaviors they want to see, not by writing values on walls. At Stripe, founders modeled user-centricity and humility daily, which spoke louder than any formal declaration. This consistency in action—whether in meetings, decisions, or feedback—creates a culture that replicates those behaviors across the organization.
