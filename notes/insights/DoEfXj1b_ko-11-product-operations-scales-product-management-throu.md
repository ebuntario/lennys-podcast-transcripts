[[concepts/product-operations|Product Operations]] helps scale product management by focusing on three areas: internal data/insights to inform strategy, customer research/market insights (external data), and standardizing cross-functional processes and cadences. It enables product managers by providing tools and systems, not by centralizing or taking away their responsibilities.
