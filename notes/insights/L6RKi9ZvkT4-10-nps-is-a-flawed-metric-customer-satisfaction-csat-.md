The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is poorly designed from a survey science perspective due to its 0-10 scale, lack of labels, and flawed "likelihood to recommend" question. A simple [[concepts/customer-satisfaction|customer satisfaction (CSAT)]] metric has better data properties, is more precise, and correlates more strongly with business outcomes. The industry reliance on NPS is more about marketing than accurate measurement.
