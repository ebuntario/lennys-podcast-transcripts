It's easy to over-engineer a product to prevent edge-case abuse or support poorly-suited users, which can distort the core experience. Instead, focus design and development efforts on the user who will immediately understand and derive maximum value from the product. Optimizing for the best user experience creates a stronger foundation that can later be adapted, rather than building constraints for a hypothetical worst user from the start.
