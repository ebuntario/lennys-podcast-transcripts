It's necessary for improving [[concepts/decision-making|decision quality]] to take what's implicit and make it explicit. Your intuition is sometimes right, but if you don't make it explicit, you don't get to find out when it's wrong. This allows you to examine, discuss, and refine your underlying assumptions.
