Anger is not a base emotion but a protective cover for underlying pain. When we feel hurt, our brain may externalize that feeling as anger to avoid experiencing the discomfort directly. The healthier response is to allow yourself to feel the pain internally, which prevents damaging relationships by projecting that pain onto others through angry outbursts.
