A key shift in mindset is accepting that you are accountable for business outcomes (like revenue or growth) even though they are influenced by factors outside your direct control, such as market shifts or competitor actions. While this can be scary, it is the reality of working in a business. Embracing this leads to freedom and focus: you concentrate on doing your best to influence outcomes through customer discovery and smart work, rather than fighting for perfect process adherence.
