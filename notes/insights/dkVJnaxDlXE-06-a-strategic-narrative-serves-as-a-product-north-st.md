A well-defined narrative provides a strategic north star for [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]] and [[concepts/roadmap-prioritization|roadmap prioritization]]. It creates a clear bar for evaluating feature requests: if a feature helps customers win the new game, it's prioritized; if it doesn't, it's deprioritized. This aligns product development with the core company message and movement.
