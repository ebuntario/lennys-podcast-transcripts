Treat [[concepts/artificial-intelligence|AI tools]] like ChatGPT as cognitive prosthetics that help you overcome obstacles and maintain a state of flow. When you get stuck on a technical problem or need to research a topic, querying AI allows you to continue progressing without losing momentum. This is especially valuable for individuals with ADHD or anyone who needs to bypass frustrating roadblocks to stay productive.
