When evaluating career opportunities, look for the overlap between your [[concepts/strengths-based-work|superpowers]] and the company's superpowers. A strong resonance here creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for growth, irrespective of location or initial compensation. This principle of aligning complementary strengths can also apply to building strong personal and professional relationships.
