The [[concepts/foundation-sprint|Foundation Sprint]] is a structured 10-hour process where a core team clears their calendar to make key strategic decisions together at the very beginning of a project. This intensive session helps teams align on fundamentals like target customer, core problem, and competition, which are often assumed but not explicitly agreed upon. The output is a clear founding hypothesis that serves as a North Star for subsequent development and testing.
