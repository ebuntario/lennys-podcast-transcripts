Transforming a large company's product culture is like chipping away at calcification; you can't change everything at once. Start by creating a "startup lab" or identifying a small, empowered team with a supportive leader to pilot new ways of working. Let this team's success and learnings become a model that gradually influences and teaches other parts of the organization.
