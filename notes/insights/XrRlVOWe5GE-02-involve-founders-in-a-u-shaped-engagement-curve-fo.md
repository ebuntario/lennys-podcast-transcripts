For major new initiatives, engage founder-CEOs heavily at the start for strategic buy-in and again at the end for quality validation, while giving the team space to run in the middle. This "U-curve" of involvement ensures alignment on goals and anti-goals early on, and co-creation on final polish before launch. It prevents the painful scenario where a founder sees the finished product and feels it doesn't meet the company's quality bar.
