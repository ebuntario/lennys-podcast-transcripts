As organizations grow, a mismatch arises between the supply of "known valuable work" and the demand to do work, leading to [[concepts/hyperrealistic-work|hyper-realistic work-like activities]]. These are superficially identical to real work (meetings, decks, analysis) but create negligible value. Leadership's responsibility is to ensure clarity on priorities and a sufficient supply of genuinely valuable work to prevent this waste.
