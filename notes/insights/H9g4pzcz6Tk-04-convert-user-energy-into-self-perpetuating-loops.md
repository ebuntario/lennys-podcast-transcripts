Every user interaction is kinetic energy that a great product converts back into the experience. The strongest mechanism is a [[concepts/network-effects|network effect]], where each user makes the product better for others. Additionally, founders must identify and maximize [[concepts/growth-loops|growth and re-engagement loops]], such as sharing features or notifications triggered by user actions, to make the product self-perpetuating.
