Acts of generosity—toward employees, customers, or partners—are demonstrations of cooperation in an iterated game. This builds trust and encourages reciprocal cooperation, creating long-term mutual benefit. An ethical, value-creating approach attracts better talent, improves workplace culture, and establishes a sustainable foundation for success beyond short-term maximization.
