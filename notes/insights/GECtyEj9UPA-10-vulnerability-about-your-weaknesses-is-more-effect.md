When you have a known weakness (e.g., low openness), you have three choices: hide it, be unapologetically abrasive, or be vulnerable about it. Hiding and being unapologetic are "ruinous" compared to vulnerability. Openly stating, "This abstract thinking isn't my natural strength, so I need help translating," builds trust, reduces translation time for the team, and is far more effective for [[concepts/team-dynamics|team dynamics]].
