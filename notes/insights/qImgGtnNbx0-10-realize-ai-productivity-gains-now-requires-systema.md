Early AI tools like coding assistants can decrease productivity if the generated code is flawed, as reviewing unfamiliar code is cognitively taxing. To realize gains immediately, implement a system of [[concepts/root-cause-analysis|root cause analysis]]: for every error, determine what context the AI lacked to produce the correct output. By systematically improving the context provided to the AI (e.g., via Model Context Protocol), you create a virtuous cycle of improvement rather than waiting for the models to magically get better.
