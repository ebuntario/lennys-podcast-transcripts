CEDAF stands for Comprehension, Excitement, De-risk, Align, and Feedback. This [[concepts/delegation-framework|structured approach]] ensures people have what they need, understand why it matters, risks are mitigated, alignment is confirmed, and feedback loops are short. It's particularly useful for delegating to AI agents.
