Growth should not feel like a separate layer added on top of product development; it should be infused into the company's DNA from the beginning. This means integrating go-to-market, monetization, and user feedback considerations into early product discussions. When the entire company is engaged in growth thinking, it leads to more cohesive strategies and prevents the growth team from operating in a silo.
