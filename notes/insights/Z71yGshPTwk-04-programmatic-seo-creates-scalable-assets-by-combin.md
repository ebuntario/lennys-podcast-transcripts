[[concepts/programmatic-seo|Programmatic SEO]] involves creating pages by combining multiple data sources (like TripAdvisor with hotel data or Zillow with property data) rather than writing individual editorial content. This approach works best when there's genuine user demand for the information at scale. The key is ensuring each page serves a real user need rather than just creating content for search engines.
