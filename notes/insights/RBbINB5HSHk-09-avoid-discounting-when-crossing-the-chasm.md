Discounting is a deadly sin when crossing the chasm because pragmatists are making a risk-bearing decision, not a price-based one. Discounting can actually increase perceived risk, suggesting lower quality or support. Instead, use value-based pricing anchored to the severe cost of the problem you're solving, as customers prioritize a guaranteed solution over a cheap one.
