The decision to pivot should be based on cold rationality about whether you have exhausted all realistic possibilities for the current idea, not on avoiding the humiliation of failure. Creating emotional distance is essential to make an intellectual decision. The expected value of continuing must be compared to alternatives, like a smart fold in poker.
