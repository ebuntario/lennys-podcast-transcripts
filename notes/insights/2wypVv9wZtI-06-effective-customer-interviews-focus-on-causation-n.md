The goal of a [[concepts/customer-interviews|Jobs-to-be-Done interview]] is to uncover the causal story of why someone acted, not to collect their opinions or wishes. Use techniques from investigative interrogation, like playing back details incorrectly so the person corrects you and elaborates. Focus on people who have recently taken action (bought, switched, churned) and ask for the timeline of events that led to "today being the day" they decided.
