If you lack deep growth expertise, leverage your network to vet potential hires or advisors. Ask a trusted growth expert or existing advisor to conduct a first-pass assessment of candidates; it's a relatively small ask for them but provides immense value. This de-risks the hiring process and ensures you're bringing in someone with genuine, high-level expertise.
