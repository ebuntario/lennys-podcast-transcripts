When integrating a new technological wave like LLMs, first allow teams to diverge: let go of existing roadmaps and explore how the technology can solve core objectives creatively. After a period of broad experimentation and learning, leadership should then converge: top-down, select the few biggest bets and reallocate resources and focus to them. This balances [[concepts/innovation|creative exploration]] with disciplined execution.
