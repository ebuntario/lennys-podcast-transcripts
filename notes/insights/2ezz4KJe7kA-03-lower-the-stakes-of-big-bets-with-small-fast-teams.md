The perceived risk of innovation increases when projects are large, long-term, and lack early customer feedback. To lower the stakes, start new initiatives with very small teams (e.g., one engineer and one PM/designer) and treat them like internal startups. This [[concepts/team-structure|lean structure]] allows for rapid prototyping, quick customer validation, and limits resource exposure until the idea proves viable.
