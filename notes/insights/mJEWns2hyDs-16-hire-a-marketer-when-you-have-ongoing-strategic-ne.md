Consider hiring a full-time marketer when you have persistent strategic problems better solved by an expert, or when managing multiple freelancers/agencies becomes burdensome. For marketing-driven businesses, this often happens around the 10-person mark. Look for a T-shaped marketer deep in one function but capable across others.
