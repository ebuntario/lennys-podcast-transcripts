Discussing project work in one-on-ones creates a game of telephone, as engineering and design leads miss the conversation. Instead, use weekly tag-ups with the core triad (PM, engineering, design) to align on progress and blockers. This practice moves critical discussions into a [[concepts/cross-functional-collaboration|group setting]] where everyone hears the same information.
