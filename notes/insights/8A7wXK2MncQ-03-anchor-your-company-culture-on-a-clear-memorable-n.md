A powerful, simple cultural tenet like "We want our customers to love us fanatically" acts as a daily North Star for decision-making. When this value is deeply internalized by employees—not just posted on a wall—it creates a consistent bias towards the customer in every trade-off. This clarity helps teams prioritize long-term love over short-term convenience or financial pressure.
