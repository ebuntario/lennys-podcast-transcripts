Marketplaces can drive retention by closing the "habit loop" initiated by user actions. For example, when a user favorites an item, the platform can later notify them if it goes on sale or is selling out. Using [[concepts/push-notifications|push notifications]] and feeds to deliver these updates turns passive intent into active re-engagement, creating a powerful mechanism for bringing buyers back.
