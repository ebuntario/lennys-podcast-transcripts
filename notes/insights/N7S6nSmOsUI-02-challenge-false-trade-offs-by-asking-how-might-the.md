When faced with a seemingly impossible choice or scarcity mindset, ask yourself, "How might the opposite be true?" This simple question can break the frame of a false trade-off and open up new, previously unseen paths. It helps shift from a fixed, win-lose mentality to a more creative and abundant [[concepts/mindset|mindset]], reducing stress and revealing that you can often achieve multiple objectives.
