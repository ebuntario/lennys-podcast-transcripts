Building a [[concepts/diverse-teams|diverse team]] with varied ethnic, cultural, and geographic backgrounds makes developing global products more efficient. Instead of spending weeks recruiting user panels, team members can simulate real-world user perspectives through internal debate based on their lived experiences. This diversity helps uncover edge cases and design considerations that a homogeneous team might miss, accelerating the [[concepts/global-product-development|product development]] process.
