Assume no one wants to hear what you have to say, and use [[concepts/story-stakes|stakes]] to make them constantly wonder about the next sentence. Stakes are what the audience should be worried about or hoping for—they create investment. Techniques include planting an "elephant" (a big worry early), using a "backpack" (sharing your plan so the audience hopes with you), and dropping "breadcrumbs" (hints of what's to come).
