Effective product team structure aligns with target personas and core problems. Teams can be organized around core user experience and growth (acquisition, activation), enterprise needs (IT admins, departmental leaders), and platform/integration work. This allows teams to deeply understand and own their specific user personas, leading to more focused and valuable feature development.
