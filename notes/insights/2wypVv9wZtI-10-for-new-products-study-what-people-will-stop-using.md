When building a [[concepts/zero-to-one|zero-to-one product]], identify what existing product or behavior your solution will replace (e.g., "I want them to stop using Craigslist"). Go interview people who recently used that competitor to understand the job they were hiring it to do. There are very few new jobs; innovation usually involves serving an existing job better through new technology, informed by understanding the current hire/fire criteria.
