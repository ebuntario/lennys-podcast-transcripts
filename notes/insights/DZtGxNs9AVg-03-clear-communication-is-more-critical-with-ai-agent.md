When working with an [[concepts/ai-tools|AI agent]], you must be extremely clear and specific about what you expect and what isn't working. Instead of saying "it doesn't work," you need to explain the exact discrepancy between the expected and actual outcome. This precision in communication is even more important with AI than with human collaborators to avoid wasted iterations.
