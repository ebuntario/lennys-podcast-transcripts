While founders may struggle with the opening or closing parts of a sale, they are typically exceptional "middlers." They excel at the middle of the conversation—deeply discussing the product, the market, and customer workflows. This strength is valuable because early customers love talking to the CEO, and founders possess superior product and market knowledge compared to any hired sales rep.
