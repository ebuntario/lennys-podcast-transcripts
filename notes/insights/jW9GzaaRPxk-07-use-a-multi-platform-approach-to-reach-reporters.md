Don't rely solely on email. Use Twitter DMs for quick, relevant comments on a reporter's work, LinkedIn for podcast hosts, and email for more formal pitches. Starting with a short, friendly note on one platform (e.g., "Are you open to guest ideas?") can open the door for a more detailed conversation later.
