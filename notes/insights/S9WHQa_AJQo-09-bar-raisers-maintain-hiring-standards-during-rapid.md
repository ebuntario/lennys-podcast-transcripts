The [[concepts/bar-raiser-program|Bar Raiser program]] addresses the "new people hiring new people" problem during hypergrowth by embedding objective interviewers in hiring loops. These trained individuals run debrief meetings using behavioral interviewing against leadership principles. They help hiring managers make better decisions without using veto power, maintaining cultural and functional standards despite scaling pressure.
