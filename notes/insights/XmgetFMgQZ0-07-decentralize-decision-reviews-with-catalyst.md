Traditional review forums with standing attendees and single-threaded topics create bottlenecks. A system like Catalyst uses flexible time blocks and clear roles (Driver, Maker, Braintrust, Interested) to run multiple concurrent reviews with the right stakeholders. This increases [[concepts/organizational-velocity|throughput]] and ensures decisions aren't delayed by calendar scarcity.
