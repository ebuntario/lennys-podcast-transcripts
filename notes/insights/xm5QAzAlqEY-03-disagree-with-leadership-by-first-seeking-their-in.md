When you disagree with a leader's directive, first ask: "What would have to be true for them to be right?" This exercise in [[concepts/humility|humility]] forces you to understand their perspective, which is often informed by decades of experience you lack. You can then advocate for your view more effectively or, if you still disagree, explain their rationale respectfully to your team while committing to execute well.
