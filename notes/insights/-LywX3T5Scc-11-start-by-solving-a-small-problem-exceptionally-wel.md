The best starting point is identifying a clear, painful problem for a specific group and solving it so well they love the product. Don't overthink the initial wedge or expansion strategy; instead, deeply understand user pain points through direct interaction. This [[concepts/customer-discovery|problem-centered]] approach, rather than building a solution in search of a problem, creates a solid foundation for eventual expansion into larger markets.
