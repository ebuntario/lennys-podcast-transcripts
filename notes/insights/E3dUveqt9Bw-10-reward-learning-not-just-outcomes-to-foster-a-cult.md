To encourage teams to make bold decisions with imperfect information, explicitly reward the [[concepts/testing|learning]] derived from an initiative, not just the outcome. Frame decisions around testable hypotheses, so if results diverge, you can analyze what was learned about customers or the business. This builds [[concepts/psychological-safety|psychological safety]] and a culture where smart risks are valued.
