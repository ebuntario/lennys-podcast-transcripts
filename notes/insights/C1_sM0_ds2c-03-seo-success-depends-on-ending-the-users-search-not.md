The primary goal of SEO content should be to fully answer the searcher's query so they don't need to return to Google. Analyze search intent and use tools like "People also ask" to anticipate follow-up questions. High-quality content that resolves the query will naturally perform better than articles stuffed with keywords but lacking comprehensive answers.
