At Canva, the traditional manager role is replaced by a [[concepts/coaching-culture|coach]] who focuses on skill development and career trajectory. Coaches are peers within the same specialty who understand the required skills and potential growth paths. This system prioritizes personal development over traditional managerial oversight, fostering a growth mindset.
