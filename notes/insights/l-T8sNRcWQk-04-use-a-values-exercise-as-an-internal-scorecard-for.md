Conduct a [[concepts/values-clarification|values exercise]] by selecting resonant words from a list and ranking them to define your personal principles. This creates an internal scorecard to evaluate decisions against what truly matters to you, rather than external pressures like status or money. Regularly applying these values to choices ensures alignment and helps avoid long-term career traps.
