You can identify your market phase by budget dynamics: in the Early Market, you must create budget; in the Bowling Alley, you must redirect existing budget; in the Tornado, budget is already allocated for your category; on Main Street, budget is established and predictable. Using a qualification tactic like "do you have budget?" is fatal in the early phases where it doesn't exist yet.
