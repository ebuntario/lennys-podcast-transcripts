A key principle for winning developer adoption is to take the product to users within their existing workflows rather than pulling them out. For example, Snyk's GitHub integration allows one user to connect a repository, and then hundreds of developers working on that code can benefit from security fixes via automated pull requests without needing to sign up. Keeping users in their flow is an incredibly important concept for [[concepts/developer-experience|developer experience]] and reduces friction dramatically.
