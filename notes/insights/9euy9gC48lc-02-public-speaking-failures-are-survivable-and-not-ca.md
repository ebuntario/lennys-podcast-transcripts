Even the most dramatic public speaking failure, like freezing on stage in front of thousands, is survivable and often becomes a memorable story rather than a career-ender. The key is to adapt in the moment and not let the experience define you. While the memory may create a tiny doubt before future talks, it teaches that most professional setbacks are not as big a deal as they feel in the moment, and you can always turn the situation around.
