A [[concepts/pivot|pivot]] is formally defined as a change in strategy without a change in vision. In practice, building a startup is often a process of [[concepts/self-discovery|self-discovery]], where the founder's vision itself evolves as they are forced to make real-world trade-offs. The connective thread from the old idea to the new one is usually a critical insight or element carried over, not a complete restart.
