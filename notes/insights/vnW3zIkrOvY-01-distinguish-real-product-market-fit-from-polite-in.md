Real [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]] is signaled by customers pushing for the next step, not just giving polite affirmation. In B2B, strong signals include asking about pricing, requesting proof-of-value timelines, or immediately connecting you to their internal teams. Founders must cultivate a bias for detecting deep enthusiasm and commitment, rather than accepting vague positive feedback.
