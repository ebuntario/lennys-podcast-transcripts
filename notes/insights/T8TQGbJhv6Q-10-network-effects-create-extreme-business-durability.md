[[concepts/network-effects|Network effects]] occur when the value to a user increases as more people use the product, creating a powerful barrier to competition. A business with strong network effects is incredibly hard to kill; for example, the last telegraph was sent over 100 years after invention because the network persisted. While the user base may remain, the revenue side (e.g., advertisers) can be vulnerable if value erodes.
