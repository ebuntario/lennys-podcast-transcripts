Effective product managers should spend the majority of their time thinking about the customer, market, and competitor perspectives, not internal matters. This means starting every document and conversation from an external viewpoint, supported by data and anecdotes. By doing this, you shift from being seen as an obstacle to someone the team wants to help win, because you're framing opportunities in terms of real-world value.
