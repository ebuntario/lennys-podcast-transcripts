The advice to "ignore competitors" is outdated and dangerous in crowded markets where CAC has skyrocketed. A formal [[concepts/competitive-analysis|competitive intelligence]] program (e.g., white-labeled surveys to competitors' customers) is crucial for strategic positioning. However, this intelligence should be kept from product teams to ensure they remain 100% focused on the customer, not feature parity.
