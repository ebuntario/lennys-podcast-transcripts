Beyond a company-wide [[concepts/growth-loops|growth model]], individual product pods should have their own "mini-models" to manage specific business tensions. For example, a marketplace quality team models the trade-off between adding new supply (boosting short-term GMV) and degrading customer experience (hurting long-term retention). These models help teams articulate their strategy and quantify their impact on a north star metric.
