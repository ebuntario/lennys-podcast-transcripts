[[concepts/story-ideas|Homework for Life]] is a daily practice of recording one story-worthy moment from your day in a simple spreadsheet. This builds a lens for storytelling, helps you see patterns in your life, and prevents days from being lost. Over time, you'll capture more moments and recover past memories, creating an endless bank of stories and slowing down your perception of time.
