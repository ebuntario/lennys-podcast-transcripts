You cannot attack an incumbent leader by offering a slightly better version of the same solution to the same problem, as seen with failures like Threads or the Amazon Fire phone. To create a new category, you must either solve a completely new problem or [[concepts/problem-framing|reframe an existing problem]] in a radically different way. This shift in perspective opens people's minds to a new solution, moving them from the status quo ("from") to a new and better future state ("to").
