A key promise to employees is that they deserve to understand *why* a decision is made, even if they disagree. Forcing yourself to [[concepts/explain|explain]] your reasoning is the best way to clarify your own thinking and share knowledge across the organization. Avoid dismissing ideas as "art" or "magic"; push for scientific, explainable rationale to build a culture of clarity.
