The [[concepts/working-backwards|working backwards]] approach begins by identifying customer problems without considering engineering, financial, or resource constraints. Teams then work backward from ideal customer solutions to determine necessary work. This contrasts with starting from business metrics like revenue growth, which can lead to solutions that don't address fundamental customer needs.
