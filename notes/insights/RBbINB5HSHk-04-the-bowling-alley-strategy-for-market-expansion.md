After dominating a beachhead, expand into adjacent segments using the bowling alley strategy. Adjacency means either the same customer with a different use case (leveraging customer references) or the same use case with a different customer base (leveraging partner ecosystems). This methodical, adjacent expansion builds momentum and scales the business from tens to hundreds of millions.
