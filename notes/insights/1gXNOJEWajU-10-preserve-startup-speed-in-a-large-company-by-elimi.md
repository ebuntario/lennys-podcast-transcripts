To maintain startup-like speed within a large organization, focus on eliminating *unnecessary* complexities and bureaucracy. While some slowdown for stakeholder alignment is inevitable, challenge processes that don't add value. Leadership should explicitly empower acquired teams to move fast and even teach the larger organization how to increase its pace, turning speed into a cultural value.
