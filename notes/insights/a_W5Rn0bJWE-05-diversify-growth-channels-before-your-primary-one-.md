Relying on a single [[concepts/growth-strategy|growth channel]], such as SEO, is risky because algorithm changes can abruptly cut off traffic. Proactively experimenting with and building other channels (paid, referrals, etc.) is a critical form of business risk management. This diversification should begin while the primary channel is still strong, not after it starts to decline.
