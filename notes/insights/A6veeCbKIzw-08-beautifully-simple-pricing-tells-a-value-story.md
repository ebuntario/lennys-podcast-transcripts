Early-stage pricing should be simple enough that a customer can easily explain it to someone else. The price must tell a [[concepts/value-story|value story]], contextualizing the cost in terms of the benefit received. For example, Superhuman framed its $30/month price as "a dollar a day for four hours of productivity back per week," making the value immediately tangible.
