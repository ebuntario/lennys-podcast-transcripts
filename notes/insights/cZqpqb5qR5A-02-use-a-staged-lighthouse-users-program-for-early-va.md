Instead of chasing broad metrics like monthly active users too early, structure early development around a [[concepts/lighthouse-users-program|Lighthouse Users program]]. Start with 10 users to deeply understand problems and solutions, then expand to 100 to test scenario variations, and finally scale to 1,000 to ensure the product is self-service. This approach provides qualitative, empathetic feedback and prevents alienating a large customer base with an unpolished experience.
