Founders are often told by advisors that it's "too early" to implement mission-aligned [[concepts/corporate-governance|governance]] structures, and this advice persists until the company is on the "rails" to an IPO or acquisition, when it becomes "too late." Proactive founders must overcome this inertia by specifically asking their lawyers about protective mechanisms and insisting on their implementation to safeguard the company's long-term soul and purpose.
