Effective cold outreach starts by explaining why the message is relevant to the recipient's specific role. The messaging should then introduce a counterintuitive insight or a "shock value" statement that makes the reader pause, focusing on the problem you're passionate about solving rather than your solution. Keep the message concise (3-4 sentences) so it's readable on a mobile phone without scrolling.
