Leaders must actively create momentum, especially in early stages. Setting and sticking to manufactured, arbitrary deadlines (e.g., "we launch May 1st because we said so") forces action and prevents projects from stalling in pursuit of perfection. This practice creates a culture of [[concepts/execution|execution]] over endless deliberation.
