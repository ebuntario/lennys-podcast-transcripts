The most effective marketing technologists maintain a [[concepts/tool-agnostic]] mindset, focusing on solving business problems rather than advocating for specific tools. They evaluate solutions based on current needs and future scalability rather than personal preferences. This approach prevents technology lock-in and ensures systems evolve with business requirements rather than being constrained by existing tool capabilities.
