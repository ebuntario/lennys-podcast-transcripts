As Jeff Bezos noted, when you have data and an anecdote, the anecdote is often right. Quantitative data can show *what* is happening, but direct customer stories reveal the *why*—the emotion, context, and nuance. Prioritize listening to raw customer voices to complement and interpret your quantitative metrics.
