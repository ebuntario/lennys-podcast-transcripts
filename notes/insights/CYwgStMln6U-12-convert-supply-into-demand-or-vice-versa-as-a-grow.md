A clever [[concepts/growth-levers|growth lever]] is converting one side of your marketplace into the other. For example, during a supply crunch, Lyft tested prompting riders to become drivers. While it didn't work significantly for them, Uber found success with this tactic. The key is to test whether this cross-conversion aligns with your user psychology and provides a meaningful boost to the side you need to grow.
