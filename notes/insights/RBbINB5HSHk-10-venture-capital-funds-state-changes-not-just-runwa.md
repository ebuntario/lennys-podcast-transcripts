The purpose of a venture round is to use the capital to change the value state of your company, making it worth 2-3x more for the next round. For the chasm-crossing round, the goal is to transition from a "cool possibility" to a "going concern"—a viable, repeatable business with a loyal customer base and partner ecosystem that can survive without more funding.
