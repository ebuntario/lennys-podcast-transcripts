There is no clear, consensus definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), making it a nebulous target compared to specific AI milestones. The original, audacious question of whether machines can think like humans remains the true north star for the field. Focusing on concrete problems and measurable [[concepts/ai-progress|advancements]] is more productive than debating vague [[concepts/agi|AGI]] timelines.
