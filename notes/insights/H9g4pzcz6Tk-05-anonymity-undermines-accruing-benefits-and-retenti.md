Pure anonymity in a product prevents the creation of accruing benefits and mounting loss, which are crucial for long-term retention. Without a persistent identity, a user's experience doesn't improve over time, and they can leave and return without consequence. This structural challenge often leads to early viral growth but persistent difficulty in building an enduring community.
