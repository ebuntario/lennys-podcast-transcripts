Many organizations fall into a low-impact death spiral where teams prioritize safe, cosmetic feature additions over high-impact work that touches the core business engine. This accumulation of low-impact features makes the product more complex and interdependent, which in turn makes high-impact work even harder, perpetuating the cycle. Teams must proactively seek out high-impact work, even if it invites more scrutiny and coordination challenges, to break this spiral.
