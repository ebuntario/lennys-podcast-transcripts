In product development, one plus one often equals one and a half due to the principle of irreducible complexity. Adding more features increases systemic complexity, which can degrade the overall user experience if not managed carefully. Therefore, teams must constantly pay attention to [[concepts/product-simplicity|simplicity]] to prevent the product from becoming a monstrosity, even when individual local decisions seem correct.
