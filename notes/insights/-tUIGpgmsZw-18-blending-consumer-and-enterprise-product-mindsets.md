Experience in both consumer (e.g., Glassdoor) and enterprise (e.g., Box) product environments is highly valuable for modern SaaS products that blend both models. The consumer mindset brings skills in funnel optimization, growth, and A/B testing, while the enterprise mindset focuses on deep customer problem-solving and scalability. A product like Calendly, which has both PLG and sales-led motions, benefits from leaders who can apply both mindsets.
