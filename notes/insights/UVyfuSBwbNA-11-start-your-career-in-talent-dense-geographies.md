For a tech career, start in intensely talent-dense areas like the US West Coast to maximize access to high-growth companies and powerful networks. If that's not possible, aim for secondary hubs specific to your industry (e.g., Dubai for crypto, Bangalore for Indian tech). The brand and experience gained there become portable assets for future global opportunities.
