Create black-and-white "always rules" (e.g., "I will workout daily unless I'm commuting or deathly sick") instead of flexible "sometimes rules" for better [[concepts/habit-formation|habit formation]]. The [[concepts/streak-psychology|psychology of maintaining a streak]] makes it harder to break the chain, building powerful [[concepts/self-control|self-control]] over time. These rules must be sustainable forever, not just aspirational for a short period.
