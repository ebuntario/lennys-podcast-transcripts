While MVPs are useful for early validation, they can limit product creativity and lead to poor technical architecture. Instead, design for the most complex, demanding use case first, even if you don't build it initially. This ensures the foundational model and architecture can scale to handle future complexity, saving massive rework later and enabling true [[concepts/differentiation|differentiation]].
