Before writing any code, write a mock press release announcing the product to its intended customer. If you can't explain in two paragraphs why the customer should care, more work is needed. This technique, borrowed from Amazon, forces teams to crystallize the core value proposition and ensures alignment on the "why" before investing in the "how."
