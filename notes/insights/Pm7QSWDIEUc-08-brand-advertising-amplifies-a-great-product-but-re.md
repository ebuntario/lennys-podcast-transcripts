Effective [[concepts/brand-advertising|brand advertising]] can build multi-year awareness, but it must be sustained over a long period and is only effective if it amplifies a fantastic product experience. A smaller, consistent, and strategic spend (like Snowflake's single billboard) can be more effective than a large, scattered campaign. The advertising creative should have a twist of humor, personality, or truth that makes it memorable and sticks in people's minds.
