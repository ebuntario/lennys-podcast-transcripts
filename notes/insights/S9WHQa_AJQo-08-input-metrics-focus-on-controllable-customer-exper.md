[[concepts/input-metrics|Input metrics]] measure aspects of customer experience that teams can directly control, like selection breadth, price competitiveness, or delivery speed. These differ from output metrics like revenue that result from improving inputs. Teams should instrument every step of the customer journey to identify which inputs most drive desired outputs through iterative measurement and improvement.
