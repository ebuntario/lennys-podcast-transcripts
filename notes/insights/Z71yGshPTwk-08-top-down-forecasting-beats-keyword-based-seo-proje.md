Traditional [[concepts/seo-forecasting|SEO forecasting]] using keyword tools often produces inaccurate numbers because these tools estimate search volume. Instead, use top-down market sizing: estimate your target audience size, what percentage might search online, and your potential market penetration. This approach better reflects true opportunity than unreliable keyword volume data.
