As [[concepts/ai-productivity|AI tools]] remove the execution bottleneck for building software, the limiting factor shifts to an individual's or team's ability to generate valuable, novel ideas. The critical skill for product builders becomes [[concepts/idea-generation|generative capacity]]—the speed and quality of conceiving new concepts, features, and solutions. This reorients focus from implementation mastery to strategic creativity.
