With [[concepts/ai-tools|AI tools]] automating much of the coding, the primary bottleneck shifts from engineering execution to figuring out what to build and having the taste to judge if it's correct. Skills like discovery, ideation, and understanding user pain points become more valuable than pure technical implementation. This changes the core value proposition of product teams from building to defining and validating.
