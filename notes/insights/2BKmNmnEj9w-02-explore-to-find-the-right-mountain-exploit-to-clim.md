The [[concepts/explore-exploit-framework|explore and exploit framework]] involves two modes: exploration is finding the right mountain to climb (discovering opportunities), while exploitation is focusing resources to climb that mountain effectively (executing on wins). Teams should oscillate between these modes to avoid stagnation from over-exploiting or lack of strategy from over-exploring.
