Effective [[concepts/customer-development|customer development]] requires in-person conversations rather than relying on analytics dashboards or digital surveys. Founders should overcome social anxiety and schedule regular physical meetings with potential users to gather authentic feedback. This hands-on approach—exemplified by companies like Zip conducting hundreds of LinkedIn outreach calls—provides insights that passive data collection cannot capture.
