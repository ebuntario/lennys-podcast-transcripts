[[concepts/high-agency|High agency]] means finding a way to get what you want without waiting for perfect conditions or blaming circumstances. For PMs, this combines a strong ownership mindset, creative execution through challenges, and resilience. PMs who consistently exceed expectations demonstrate high agency by taking ownership and pushing through adverse conditions like resource constraints or legacy systems.
