Miro structures its product organization as AMPED—Analytics, Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Design—all embedded within each stream. This ensures diverse perspectives are included early, preventing narrow [[concepts/persona-based-development|persona-based solutions]] from creating fragmented experiences. The inclusion of product marketing specifically helps align features with positioning and competitive differentiation.
