[[concepts/product-excellence|Craft]] and [[concepts/quality|quality]] are meaningless without a defined customer and purpose. Perfection is an attribute of quality, but you must know who you are being perfect for. If craft is a core, non-negotiable value, treat it as a fixed assumption and increase experimentation on all other variables. However, craft should not be used as an excuse to avoid customer feedback.
