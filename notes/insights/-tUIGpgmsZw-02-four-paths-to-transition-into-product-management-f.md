There are multiple paths to break into [[concepts/product-leadership|product management]]. Formal routes include applying to Associate Product Manager (APM) programs or junior PM roles, especially internally if you're already in a product-adjacent role like customer support or sales engineering. Informal paths include shadowing a PM, joining a subject matter expert (SME) program to partner with a product team, or joining an early-stage startup where roles are fluid and you can take on product work.
