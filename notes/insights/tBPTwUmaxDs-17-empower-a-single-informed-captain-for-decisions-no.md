For efficient [[concepts/decision-making|decision-making]], identify a single "informed captain" who is on the hook for a decision, rather than seeking consensus from a group. Empower that person to gather all necessary context and input, but ultimately own the call. This model, akin to the RAPID framework, creates clear accountability and speeds up execution.
