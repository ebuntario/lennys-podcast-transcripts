Lowering [[concepts/monetary-friction|monetary friction]] through trials, incentives, or pricing adjustments can unlock valuable user segments who might otherwise abandon their entrepreneurial journey.

This approach can reveal pockets of high-value entrepreneurs who would have given up without that initial support.
