Start [[concepts/product-led-sales]] with [[concepts/pilot-programs]] rather than company-wide implementation. For sales-led companies, partner with a pilot account executive separate from the main sales team. For product-led companies, begin with founder-led sales or have existing team members handle initial deals to understand the process. This [[concepts/evolution-not-revolution]] approach proves ROI before hiring dedicated resources and ensures proper understanding of the sales process.
