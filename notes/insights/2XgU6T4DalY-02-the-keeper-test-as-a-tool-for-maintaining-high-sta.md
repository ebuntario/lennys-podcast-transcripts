The "keeper test" is a managerial framework to maintain high standards: if a team member announced they were leaving, would you fight to keep them? If the answer is no, it signals a need for a candid conversation about fit. This tool encourages timely, direct feedback and prevents managers from avoiding difficult [[concepts/performance-management|performance]] discussions.
