Never trust what people say they will do; only trust evidence of what they have done. Customers may loudly complain about a missing feature but not actually switch products because of it, as the [[concepts/forces-of-progress|forces of habit and anxiety]] outweigh the push to change. To find real signals, interview people who have recently taken action (switched, churned) to understand the true causal mechanisms behind their decision.
