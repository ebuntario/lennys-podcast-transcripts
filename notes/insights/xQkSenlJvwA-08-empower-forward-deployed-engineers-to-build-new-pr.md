The radical element of Palantir's forward deployed engineer role was the empowerment to build completely new product features to solve a customer's problem. Unlike a solutions architect who only deploys existing tools, the FDE could innovate on the spot. This [[concepts/autonomy|autonomy]], combined with deep [[concepts/customer-empathy|customer empathy]], is a key reason the role acts as a founder training ground.
