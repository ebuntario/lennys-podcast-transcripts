Successful platforms often evolve through a deliberate sequence: starting as a single-player tool (e.g., blogging software) to earn a place in the market, then layering on network capabilities. This order of operations is critical, as doing things in the right sequence unlocks the ability to transform into a broader ecosystem, as seen with Substack's move into podcasting and community features.
