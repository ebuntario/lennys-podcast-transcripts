Avoid complex composite metrics with weighted coefficients that no one intuitively understands. Instead, choose a simple, even if imperfect, metric that teams can easily grasp and discuss. A metric people can have an intuition around will drive better outcomes than a "perfect" one that is opaque, as [[concepts/team-communication|clarity]] enables action.
