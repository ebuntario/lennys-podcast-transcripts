When you find an exciting data point, analyze what happened before it, after it, and one level above it to understand its true significance. For example, a successful onboarding intervention might only apply to 2% of users, or its users might churn quickly or have a lower average revenue. Presenting analysis that doesn't hold water damages credibility more than presenting no analysis at all.
