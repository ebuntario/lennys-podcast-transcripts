Move beyond one-way documents (like Google Docs) where discussion hides in comments. Two-way writeups incorporate features like "done reading" buttons, prioritized question tables (Dory), and sentiment polling directly into the document. This makes feedback more visible and actionable, transforming documents into [[concepts/collaboration-tools|collaborative decision-making]] spaces.
