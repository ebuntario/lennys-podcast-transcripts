People think the purpose of a meeting is for three things: discover, discuss, decide. The only thing that should happen in a meeting is the discussion part. Discovery and decision should happen independently and asynchronously to avoid cross-influence and allow for a true spread of opinions, which is a core principle of effective [[concepts/group-dynamics|group dynamics]].
