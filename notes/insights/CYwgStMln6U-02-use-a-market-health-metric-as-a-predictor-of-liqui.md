While [[concepts/marketplace-liquidity|liquidity]] (e.g., fill rate) is the ultimate output metric for a marketplace, it can be influenced by many external factors. A more actionable approach is to identify a "market health metric"—a leading predictor of liquidity that teams can directly influence. For example, at Lyft, the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of the nearest driver was a strong, plateauing predictor of whether a user would book a ride.
