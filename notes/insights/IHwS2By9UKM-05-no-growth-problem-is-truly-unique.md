Assuming your growth challenge is unique wastes time; most problems have been solved elsewhere. Seek [[concepts/advisor-role|advisors]] and peers who've faced similar issues to shortcut solution-finding. Patternize solutions using established [[concepts/growth-frameworks|growth frameworks]] rather than reinventing the wheel for each initiative.
