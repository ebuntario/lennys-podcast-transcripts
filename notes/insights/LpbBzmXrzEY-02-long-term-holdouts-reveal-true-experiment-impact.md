Many experiments that show short-term lift (30-40% at Shopify) reveal no long-term impact on core business metrics when evaluated a year later, often due to [[concepts/pull-forward-effect|pull-forward effects]]. By implementing long-term holdouts and automatically re-evaluating experiment cohorts at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, teams can distinguish between temporary wins and genuine value creation. This practice holds teams accountable to true business impact rather than short-term vanity metrics.
