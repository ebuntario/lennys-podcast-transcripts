Undertaking a complete [[concepts/software-development|software]] rewrite is an extremely high-risk strategy that often leads to failure, as seen in the Digg v4 story. Such projects create long periods of instability and rarely deliver the intended business outcomes. Incremental migration or refactoring is usually a safer and more effective approach.
