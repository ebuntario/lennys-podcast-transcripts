When a customer requests a feature, ask "why" they need it to uncover the underlying problem. Taking this a step further by asking why that problem exists can reveal a larger opportunity. This technique, similar to the engineering [[concepts/root-cause-analysis|five whys]] used in postmortems, helps product teams move beyond surface-level requests to address foundational conditions and create greater impact.
