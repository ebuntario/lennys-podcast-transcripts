For many products, especially new or complex ones, the primary challenge is user comprehension, not friction. Users often arrive with very low intent and specificity about what your product does. The design must first answer "What is this?" and "What do I do next?" before worrying about streamlining a sign-up flow they don't yet understand or want.
