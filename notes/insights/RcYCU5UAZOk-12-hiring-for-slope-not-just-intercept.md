When hiring, evaluate candidates based on their potential growth trajectory (slope) rather than just their current skills (intercept). Hire slower and only when teams are genuinely stretched. This ensures there is ample scope for new hires and helps maintain a lean, high-impact organization. Prioritizing [[concepts/long-term-potential|long-term potential]] over immediate fit leads to better talent density and sustainable team scaling.
