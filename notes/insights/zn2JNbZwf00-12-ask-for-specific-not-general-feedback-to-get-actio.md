Instead of asking "How did that go?" after a presentation, ask for feedback on a specific element you're working on, like executive presence or clarity. You can also model self-critique first ("I think I could have been clearer on X. What did you think?"). This makes it easier for others to give you precise, useful feedback for [[concepts/skill-development|improvement]].
