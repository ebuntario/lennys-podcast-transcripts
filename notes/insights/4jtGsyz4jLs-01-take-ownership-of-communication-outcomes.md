When you don't get the reaction you want, first ask how you might be contributing to the confusion or skepticism. Instead of blaming others, focus on improving your own [[concepts/clarity|clarity]], persuasiveness, and ability to anticipate questions. This mindset of [[concepts/agency|agency]] increases the likelihood of achieving your desired outcomes.
