For maximum impact and career growth, position yourself in one of two places: on the company's most important project (the "rocket ship"), where you'll gain visibility and experience, or as the owner of a critical but unglamorous area that holds everything together. Both are highly valued, but you must be prepared for the intensity or responsibility each entails.
