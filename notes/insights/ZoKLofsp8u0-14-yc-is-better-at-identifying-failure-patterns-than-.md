It's extremely difficult to predict which startup in a batch will become a billion-dollar company, as outlier success often involves illogical, non-consensus ideas. YC's strength lies in recognizing common [[concepts/startup-failure|failure]] patterns—like not talking to users or lacking a technical founder—and steering founders away from them. Their goal is to help good teams avoid basic mistakes so they can fail in novel, interesting ways instead.
