Strategic portfolio allocation should be debated across four buckets: **Brilliant Basics** ([[concepts/tech-debt|tech debt]], core platforms), **Bread & Butter** (feature enhancements, experiments), **Big Bets** (cross-team initiatives requiring full commitment), and **Breaking Bad** (existential pivots or new company visions). Framing [[concepts/prioritization|prioritization]] as a choice between these buckets, with clear trade-offs, elevates it from a tactical PM decision to a strategic leadership conversation.
