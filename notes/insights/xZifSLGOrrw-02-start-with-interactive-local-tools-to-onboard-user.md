An initial version of an [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agent]] that operates as a remote, asynchronous cloud agent can be too advanced for initial [[concepts/onboarding|user onboarding]]. A more effective strategy is to first integrate the agent as an interactive tool within the user's existing local environment (like an IDE or CLI). This allows users to build trust and learn how to prompt the agent effectively in a familiar, low-friction context before delegating larger autonomous tasks.
