The most effective prioritization method is to identify the single biggest bottleneck or problem, then iterate rapidly to solve it completely. Avoid overthinking long roadmaps and instead focus on solving the most critical issue, then move to the next. This simple algorithm of constant problem identification and resolution drives faster progress than elaborate planning.
