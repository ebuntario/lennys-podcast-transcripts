Embedding models allow AI systems to find and reference specific information from a private corpus, such as company documents or podcast transcripts. This technique, central to [[concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation|retrieval-augmented generation]], grounds the AI's responses in verifiable facts rather than general knowledge. Advances in this area make it cheaper and more effective across multiple languages.
