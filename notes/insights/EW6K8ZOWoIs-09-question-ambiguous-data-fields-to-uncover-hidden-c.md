In complex systems, fields with null or generic values (like a blank "reason for payment" field) often mask numerous exceptions and edge cases. Insisting on specific, articulate values for these fields forces the team to [[concepts/systems-thinking|understand and codify the underlying reality]]. This diligence prevents hidden complexity from undermining optimizations and analyses later.
