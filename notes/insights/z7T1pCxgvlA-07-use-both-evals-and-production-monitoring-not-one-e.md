The debate between [[concepts/evaluation|evals]] and [[concepts/production-monitoring|production monitoring]] presents a false dichotomy. Evals (test datasets) ensure your system performs well on known, critical scenarios before deployment. Production monitoring (user feedback, implicit signals) catches emerging, unforeseen failure modes in real-world use. A robust system requires both strategies working in tandem.
