Your personal background challenges default [[concepts/product-assumptions|product assumptions]] that teams in tech hubs might take for granted. For example, assuming one person equals one phone number ignores realities in many countries where prepaid plans, shared devices, and dual-SIM phones are common. Incorporating these [[concepts/global-perspective|global perspectives]] early in product design prevents building for a narrow user model and enables broader adoption.
