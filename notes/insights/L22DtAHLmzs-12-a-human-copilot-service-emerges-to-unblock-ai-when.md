As AI becomes the primary builder, a new role emerges: the human expert who steps in when the AI hits a limit. This flips the old model of AI-as-copilot; now, the human is the copilot who helps debug or guide the AI. This creates services where users can pay for on-demand expert help to get "unjammed," acknowledging that [[concepts/ai-limitations|AI still has limitations]] requiring human intervention.
