A common misconception about [[concepts/product-management|product management]] is that it requires learning specific tools (like Figma). The fundamental skill is learning how to take ambiguous, complex situations and consistently drive more clarity over time. Aspiring PMs should focus on developing this [[concepts/problem-framing|clarity-creating muscle]] and the associated strategic mindset above any particular software or process.
