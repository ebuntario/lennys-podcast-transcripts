A successful [[concepts/land-and-expand|land-and-expand]] strategy requires deliberate design. Your entry-level or free product (the "land") must have a clear fence that defines what the customer gets. The "expand" motion should be based on clear upgrades, whether in features, usage, or outcomes. Giving away too much in the land phase leaves no room for future monetization.
