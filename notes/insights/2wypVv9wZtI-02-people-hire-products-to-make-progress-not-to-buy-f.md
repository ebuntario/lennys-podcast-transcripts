Products are "hired" by customers to help them make progress in a specific life situation, not merely purchased for their features. This [[concepts/hiring-metaphor|hiring metaphor]] reframes competition, revealing that a Snickers bar competes with a protein shake (for energy) while a Milky Way competes with a glass of wine (for emotional comfort). Understanding the job reveals the true, often non-obvious, competitive set from the demand side.
