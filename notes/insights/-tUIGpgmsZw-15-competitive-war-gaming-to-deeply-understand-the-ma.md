"Competitive war gaming" involves assigning teams to deeply immerse themselves in a competitor's product for a quarter, conducting SWOT analyses, and predicting the competitor's direction. Teams then present findings in a fun, prize-based session. This systematic approach consolidates market intelligence without requiring every PM to be an expert on all competitors, keeping the entire team informed about the competitive landscape.
