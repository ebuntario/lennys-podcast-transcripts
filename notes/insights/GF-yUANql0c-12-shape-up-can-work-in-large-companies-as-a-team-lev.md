You don't need the whole company to adopt Shape Up. Individual teams in large organizations can use it successfully if they have supportive engineering leadership that can untangle dependencies and protect capacity. Consistent delivery of finished work in predictable cycles often earns teams the autonomy to continue, even if the broader company operates on different cadences.
