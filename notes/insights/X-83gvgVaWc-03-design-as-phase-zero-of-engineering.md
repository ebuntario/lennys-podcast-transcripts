Design is most successful at impacting what ships when it's considered phase zero of the [[concepts/design-engineering-integration|engineering process]]. This tight integration prevents design and product from cooking up ideas that are technically impractical and ensures engineers are brought along from the beginning, fostering shared ownership. The goal is to have key engineers and product people fall in love with the concept so they can defend, embrace, and enhance it.
