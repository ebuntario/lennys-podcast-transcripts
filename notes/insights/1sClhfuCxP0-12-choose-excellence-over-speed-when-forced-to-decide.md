A contrarian take: when forced to choose between speed and excellence in [[concepts/product-development|product development]], choose excellence. Many experiments should be killed as thought experiments before they are built. While both are ideal, a bias towards thoughtful, high-quality execution often wastes less company time than a "ship fast and see" approach applied to obviously flawed ideas.
