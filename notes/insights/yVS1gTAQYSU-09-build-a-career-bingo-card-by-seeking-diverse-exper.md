Treat your career like a bingo card, intentionally seeking roles that fill in missing boxes of experience—different industries, business models, or company stages.

The return on investment for learning something outside your immediate wheelhouse can be "off the charts great," as it often becomes the crucial tool for an unexpected future challenge.
