Instead of immediately deferring to AI for answers, cultivate the skill of inquiry and the scientific process of discovery. Encourage maintaining [[concepts/independent-thought|independent thinking]] even when AI provides answers—like a child who says "You can ask Claude, but I know I'm right." This balance prevents complete cognitive delegation and preserves human agency in problem-solving.
