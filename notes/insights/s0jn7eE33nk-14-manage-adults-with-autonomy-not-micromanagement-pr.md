Employees are either adults or children in terms of needed supervision. Adults thrive with clear goals and resources, then autonomy. Children (e.g., new hires) need structure and oversight. Micromanaging adults is disrespectful and destroys [[concepts/psychological-safety|trust]]; laissez-faire management of children leads to chaos. Calibrate your approach.
