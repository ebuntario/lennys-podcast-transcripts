The "object of the new game" is a simple, aspirational phrase that acts as the rallying cry for your movement, like "turn customers into subscribers" or "belong anywhere." This becomes the customer-focused mission statement for your company. Framing it as an asymptotically unachievable ideal (e.g., "live there") can make it even more powerful and enduring.
