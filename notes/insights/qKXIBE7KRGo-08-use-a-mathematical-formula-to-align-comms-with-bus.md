To bring discipline to communications, start with a clear business goal (e.g., grow revenue by X). Identify who needs to take what action to achieve it, then determine what they need to believe to take that action. Finally, map out where they get their information. This creates a clear equation: deliver this message to these people through these channels to drive this action.
