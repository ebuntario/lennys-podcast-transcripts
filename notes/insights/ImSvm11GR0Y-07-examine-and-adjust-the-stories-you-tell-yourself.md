The narratives you create about yourself—"I'm a high-agency PM" or "I'm hyper-collaborative"—can become limiting beliefs that justify problematic behaviors. These stories shape how you operate and can hinder growth if they excuse brashness, indecisiveness, or other limitations. Regularly examine your self-perceptions with trusted colleagues and reframe them toward enabling narratives like "I'm a learner" to support continued [[concepts/professional-growth|professional development]].
