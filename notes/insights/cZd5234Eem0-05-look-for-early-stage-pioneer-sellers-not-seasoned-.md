For your first sales hires, target "grimier, grittier" sellers who were early at successful companies in your space, not senior VPs of sales. These pioneers are closer to actual selling and are comfortable with unpolished collateral and processes. A VP from a scaled company hasn't sold recently and may not want to rebuild a [[concepts/sales-operations|sales motion]] from scratch.
