Instead of blindly applying, conduct [[concepts/informational-interviews|informational interviews]] with people in roles you're considering. This process helps you test assumptions about a job, practice talking about yourself, and narrow down options based on real-world fit. It treats your career search like product development, reducing the risk of taking a role based on a flawed job description.
