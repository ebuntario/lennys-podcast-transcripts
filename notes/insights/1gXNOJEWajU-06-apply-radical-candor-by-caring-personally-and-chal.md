The [[concepts/radical-candor|Radical Candor]] framework—caring personally while challenging directly—transforms how you give feedback and manage teams. Effective feedback is a gift when delivered with genuine care for the person's growth. This approach also reframes performance issues: often, someone is underperforming because the role is a wrong fit, not because they are inherently ineffective.
