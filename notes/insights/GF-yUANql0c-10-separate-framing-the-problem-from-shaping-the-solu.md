Before shaping a solution, invest in [[concepts/problem-framing|framing]] the problem narrowly—for example, "seeing empty spaces in a calendar" rather than "building a calendar." Use techniques like Jobs-to-be-Done to understand the core struggle. This clear problem definition then feeds into the shaping sessions, ensuring the team solves the right thing and avoids scope creep.
