Forward deployed engineers (FDEs) are embedded at the customer's site, working side-by-side with them to understand and solve problems. This radical [[concepts/customer-discovery|customer development]] approach builds deep trust, allows for rapid weekly iteration cycles, and ensures the solution is tightly coupled to the real-world outcome. The FDE's mandate includes building entirely new software if needed to solve the customer's novel problem.
