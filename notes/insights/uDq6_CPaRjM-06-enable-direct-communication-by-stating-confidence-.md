Direct communication only works if it's a two-way street. To prevent others from being silent, explicitly state your confidence level in your opinions (e.g., "I feel medium confidence on this"). Create a culture where everyone feels comfortable giving feedback by asking for it first and treating [[concepts/feedback-culture|feedback as a gift]] that flows constantly, not just during formal cycles.
