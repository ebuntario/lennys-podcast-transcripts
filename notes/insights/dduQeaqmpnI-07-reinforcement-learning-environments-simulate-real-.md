[[concepts/reinforcement-learning|Reinforcement learning]] (RL) environments are simulated worlds where AI models learn by performing end-to-end tasks, like diagnosing why a website crashed using tools like Slack, Jira, and AWS. These environments reveal model weaknesses in multi-step, messy real-world scenarios that isolated benchmarks miss, providing a richer training ground that mimics human on-the-job learning.
