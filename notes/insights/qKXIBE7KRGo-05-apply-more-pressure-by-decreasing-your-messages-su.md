The equation Pressure = Force / Area applies to communications. With limited resources (force), you can create more impact (pressure) by decreasing your surface area—sharply targeting a specific audience with a tailored message. For startups, this means choosing to deeply win over a small group of die-hard fans rather than weakly appealing to a broad, general audience.
