A true product manager is a creator, not a facilitator, and is responsible for ensuring a solution is both valuable to customers and viable for the business. This requires deep expertise in customers, data, market, and business constraints like compliance, sales, and monetization. In contrast, a product owner or feature team PM often focuses on backlog administration and project management, which are not the core of the role.
