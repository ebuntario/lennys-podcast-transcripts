A product's "sizzle"—a flashy, highly shareable feature—can be crucial for initial adoption, even if it's not the core value driver. For example, satellite imagery in Google Maps (from the Keyhole acquisition) wasn't the most important feature, but it created a viral moment where millions wanted to look at their homes. This "sizzle" answers "why try this?" while the "steak" (core utility) provides enduring value that retains users.
