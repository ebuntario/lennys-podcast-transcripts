During mentor conversations, take notes. In follow-ups, reference previous advice and share the results of applying it. Also, ask how you can help them. This transforms the interaction from transactional to relational, showing you value the connection and their insights, which strengthens the [[concepts/coaching|bond]] and encourages ongoing guidance.
