Establishing [[concepts/career-ladders|career ladders]] and leveling systems is essential for fairness as you scale, but it is often done too late. Implementing these structures when you are around 160 people is better than waiting until 800, as later changes feel like a "bloodbath" and disrupt morale. While imperfect, a clear system is better than the unfairness and confusion of having none, especially for managing [[concepts/compensation|compensation]].
