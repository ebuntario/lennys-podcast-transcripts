Instead of starting with a big concept and asking for an estimate, begin by defining an [[concepts/appetite|appetite]]—the maximum time you're willing to spend. Work backward to shape a solution that fits within that fixed time box, forcing trade-offs and clarity on what can realistically be delivered. This approach mirrors setting a budget before house hunting, ensuring you make intentional choices about scope and value.
