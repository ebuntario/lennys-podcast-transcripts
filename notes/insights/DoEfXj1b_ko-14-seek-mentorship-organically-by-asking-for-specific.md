When seeking mentorship, avoid the high-pressure ask, "Will you be my mentor?" Instead, build the relationship organically by reaching out with a specific, well-defined question or career dilemma. People who enjoy helping others are more likely to respond to a concrete request for advice. This approach is more respectful of their time and allows the relationship to develop naturally based on mutual value and respect.
