Product work falls into two categories: [[concepts/solution-deepening|solution deepening]] (making the product better for existing users) and [[concepts/market-widening|market widening]] (making it available to more users, like adding new platforms). A perceived slowdown often occurs when investing in market widening, which is necessary for growth but doesn't immediately benefit current users. Understanding this distinction helps manage expectations around [[concepts/product-velocity|product velocity]].
