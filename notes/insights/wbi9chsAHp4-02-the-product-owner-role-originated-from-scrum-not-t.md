The product owner role was created within the Scrum framework to help developers prioritize work and manage the backlog. Unlike modern [[concepts/product-management|product management]], it emerged from a developer-centric need, not from market-facing business functions. Early Scrum guides even noted the product owner could be a customer or department manager, not necessarily a product manager.
