In [[concepts/product-led-sales]], the traditional go-to-market configuration changes dramatically. Instead of marketing creating pipeline for sales, the product team acquires and activates customers and creates pipeline for sales. This requires a close collaboration between product and sales, with the product team taking accountability over pipeline generation. Attempting to implement this motion solely within marketing is a recipe for failure, as product must own the selling of the product itself.
