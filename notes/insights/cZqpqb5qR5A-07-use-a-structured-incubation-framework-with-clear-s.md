A formal incubation program (like Atlassian's Point A with stages: Wonder, Explore, Make, Impact) provides shared vocabulary and clear expectations. Each stage has defined goals (e.g., validating a problem, testing a solution) and culminates in a [[concepts/stage-gate-process|stage gate review]] with leadership. This structure protects the team, manages stakeholder expectations, and ensures disciplined progression based on evidence, not opinion.
