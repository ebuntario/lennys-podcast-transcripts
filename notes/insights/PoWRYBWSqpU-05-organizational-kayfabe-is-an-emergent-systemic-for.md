[[concepts/organizational-kayfabe|Organizational kayfabe]] is a shared fiction everyone acts upon as if real, emerging from individual self-preservation (e.g., reporting optimistic status). This systemic force compounds up hierarchies, creating a dangerous gap between the official story and the [[concepts/ground-truth|ground truth]]. Acknowledging this dynamic is not cynical but necessary to navigate and create mechanisms for safe disconfirming evidence.
