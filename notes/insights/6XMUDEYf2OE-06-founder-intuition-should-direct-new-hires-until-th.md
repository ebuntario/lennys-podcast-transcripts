Founders who have achieved product-market fit possess deep, often subconscious intuition about their customers and business. New hires, even senior leaders, do not have this context. Founders should direct these experts until they demonstrate they truly "get it" and can make better decisions. Employees should proactively signal when they need direction or when they are ready to be trusted.
