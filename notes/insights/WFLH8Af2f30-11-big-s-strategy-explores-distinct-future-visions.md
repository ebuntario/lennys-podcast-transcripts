For [[concepts/strategy-types|big S strategy]], start with long-term trends and leadership interviews to generate 3-5 distinct, cohesive descriptions of the future (e.g., fully autonomous travel, hyper-speed travel, virtual travel). Build concept-car prototypes for these futures, test them with users, and push winning components into live product testing to de-risk and validate.
