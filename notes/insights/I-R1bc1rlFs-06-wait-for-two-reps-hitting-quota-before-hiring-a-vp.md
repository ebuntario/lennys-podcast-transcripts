Do not hire a VP of Sales until you have at least two sales reps consistently hitting quota. The VP's job is to scale a repeatable process from 3 to 300 reps, not to find product-market fit or be the first rep. Hiring a VP before you have a working script and proven reps is a near-guaranteed failure, as they are asked to do the impossible.
