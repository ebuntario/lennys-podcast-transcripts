Review two weeks of your calendar and mark each hour as energy-giving (green) or energy-draining (red). Analyze the red items to eliminate, delegate, or redesign them to be "exquisite." The goal is to move out of your "zone of excellence" (things you're good at but don't love) and into your [[concepts/zone-of-genius|zone of genius]], where you create unique value and gain energy from your work.
