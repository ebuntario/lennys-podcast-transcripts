Revolut operates with the principle that if something is [[concepts/99-percent-done|99% done]], it's closer to 0% than 100% complete. Product owners must ensure features are fully operational, that support teams understand them, and that marketing can effectively communicate them—otherwise the work remains unfinished despite technical completion.
