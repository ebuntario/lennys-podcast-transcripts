When stuck, systematically evaluate and potentially change one or more of the Four Ps: Persona (who you target), Problem (the need you address), Promise (your value proposition and positioning), and Product. Successful pivots, like Lattice (changing Problem, Promise, Product) or Plaid (changing three Ps), involve significant, not incremental, changes to these core elements to find a stronger market fit.
