Instead of trying to create new [[concepts/viral-growth|virality]] from scratch, identify where users are already organically sharing (like taking screenshots at specific milestones). Invest in making those moments more delightful and share-worthy with illustrations and animations. This approach of amplifying existing [[concepts/user-behavior|behavior]] is more effective than trying to manufacture sharing on the margins.
