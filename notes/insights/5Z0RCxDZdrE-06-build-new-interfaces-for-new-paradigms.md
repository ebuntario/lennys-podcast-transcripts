When a new technological paradigm (like AI writing 90% of code) changes the user's primary activity (e.g., from writing to reviewing), you must build a new interface tailored to that workflow. Don't be limited by existing platforms; custom UIs can triple acceptance rates for the same underlying technology by aligning with the new user behavior.
