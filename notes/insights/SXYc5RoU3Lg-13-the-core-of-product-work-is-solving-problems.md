At its heart, product management is about caring enough about a problem to solve it on someone else's behalf. Embracing this purpose brings passion, empathy, and customer-centricity to the work, which in turn leads to better outcomes. All frameworks and techniques serve this fundamental goal of creating value by solving meaningful problems.
