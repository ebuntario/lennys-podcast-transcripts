[[concepts/user-centered-performance|User-centered performance]] occurs when teams engage in research to signal customer obsession rather than to learn and make different decisions. A common example is a product manager requesting a "quick validation study" at the end of a process when it's too late to change anything. This performative act is driven by a desire to check a box, not by a genuine [[concepts/confirmation-bias|confirmation bias]]-resistant mindset of seeking to be wrong.
