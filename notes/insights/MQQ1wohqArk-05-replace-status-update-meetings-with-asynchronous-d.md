Meetings should be reserved for solving problems, not sharing status updates. Teams should use tools to document project progress, decisions, and rationales asynchronously, allowing people to consume information on their own schedule. This [[concepts/asynchronous-communication|asynchronous approach]] frees up meeting time for higher-value collaboration and creates a searchable record of project context and assumptions.
