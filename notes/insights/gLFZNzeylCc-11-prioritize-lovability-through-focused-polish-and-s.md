Lovable products often come from doing a few things with high quality and polish rather than many things inadequately. Strategic "pixie dust"—small, delightful extras that exceed user expectations—can be sprinkled on key features to create love. Since you can't polish everything, you must consciously choose where to invest these extra efforts for maximum impact.
