A startup market develops through a [[concepts/movement-building|movement]]—a group of people with a shared belief moving to a different future. This leverages a grievance of a minority against the tyranny of the majority. Early customers, employees, and investors are animated by belief and aesthetics, not just pragmatics. Effective [[concepts/storytelling|storytelling]] that frames the founder as the mentor and the early believer as the hero is key to catalyzing this movement.
