In a strong product organization, leaders are responsible for [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]]—making focus decisions and strategic bets on which problems to solve. Empowered teams are then given those problems and the autonomy to figure out the best solutions. This structure avoids both top-down feature dictation and bottom-up anarchy, enabling aligned innovation.
