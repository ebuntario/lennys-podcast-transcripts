Amazon uses a decentralized, "two-pizza team" model that maximizes speed and parallel execution but risks shipping a fragmented org chart. Apple uses a highly [[concepts/centralization|centralized]], functional model that delivers a cohesive user experience but can be slower. Your choice should depend on your core strategy: if a simple, unified experience is paramount, lean toward centralization; if rapid, independent innovation is key, choose decentralization.
