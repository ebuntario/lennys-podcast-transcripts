To improve your product, speak with users who dropped off at each stage of your funnel—those who downloaded but didn't register, or used it once but didn't return. They know why your product wasn't good enough for them, and their "why" reveals the barriers you need to address. This [[concepts/user-research|targeted feedback]] is more valuable than only talking to happy, successful users.
