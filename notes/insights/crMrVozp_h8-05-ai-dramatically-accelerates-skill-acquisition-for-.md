Contrary to fears about AI eliminating entry-level jobs, it actually accelerates [[concepts/skill-acceleration|skill acquisition]]. When a novice receives feedback (e.g., on writing or coding), they can record it into a prompt, allowing the AI to prevent the same mistake in the future. This enables a year's worth of progress in months, as the learner internalizes expert guidance faster through [[concepts/ai-mentorship|AI-augmented mentorship]], transforming [[concepts/professional-growth|career development]] trajectories.
