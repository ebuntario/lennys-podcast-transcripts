For building SEO capability, prioritize hiring an internal, relentless doer—even if they need to learn the channel—over relying solely on an agency. Surround this internal champion with expert advisors to transfer knowledge rapidly. This builds permanent capability within the company and is more effective than an external agency that lacks deep business context.
