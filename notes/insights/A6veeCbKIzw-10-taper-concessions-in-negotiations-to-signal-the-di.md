When giving discounts during a [[concepts/negotiation|negotiation]], taper the size of your concessions (e.g., 15%, then 5%, then 2%). This signals to the other party that the negotiation is concluding. In contrast, increasing concessions (5%, then 10%, then 15%) signals you can be pressured indefinitely and invites further demands.
