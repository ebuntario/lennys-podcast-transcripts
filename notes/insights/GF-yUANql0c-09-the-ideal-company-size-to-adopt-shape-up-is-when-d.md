Shape Up becomes particularly valuable when a company grows to around 30-50 people in product and engineering, and founders or early leaders can no longer be hands-on with everything. This is when the "organic, startup way" of working begins to fail, projects start dragging, and a reproducible system for clarity and shipping is needed to scale effectiveness.
