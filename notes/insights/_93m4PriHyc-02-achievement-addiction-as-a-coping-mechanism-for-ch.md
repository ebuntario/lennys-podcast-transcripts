Early trauma can lead to forming adaptations where self-worth becomes entirely tied to external achievement. This adaptation, while beneficial for survival in youth, can reverse course in adulthood, becoming detrimental. The drive for success can mask deep emotional pain, but eventually, these buried wounds will surface, demanding attention and healing.
