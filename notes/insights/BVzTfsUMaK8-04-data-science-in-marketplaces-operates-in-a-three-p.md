The core data science work in a marketplace follows a cycle: 1) finding potential matches (search/recommendation), 2) making the match (ranking/selection algorithms), and 3) learning from the matches (ratings, feedback, passive data). Each stage relies on data and algorithms to reduce friction, and insights from stage three feed back to improve stages one and two.
