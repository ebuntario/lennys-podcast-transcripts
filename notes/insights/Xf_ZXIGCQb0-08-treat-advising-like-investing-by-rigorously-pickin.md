Aspiring growth advisors should adopt an investor's mindset when selecting companies to work with, especially if compensated with equity. Create a decision framework or spreadsheet to evaluate the company's likelihood of a successful exit, as your time is a limited resource. Ensure the equity structure has a long tail (e.g., 10+ years) to account for the typical timeline of company growth and liquidity events.
