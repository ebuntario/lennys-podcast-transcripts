A critical part of [[concepts/organizational-product-strategy|product strategy]] is consciously deciding what your product will not do well, ensuring your [[concepts/trade-offs|trade-offs]] match those your customers are willing to make. Most product failures occur when a company's trade-offs conflict with the customer's. For example, Basecamp stays simple by not adding complex features like Gantt charts, which aligns with their customers' priority on simplicity over advanced functionality.
