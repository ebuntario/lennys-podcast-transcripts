Marketplaces evolve by justifying higher commissions through managing more of the value chain, from simple lead generation (Marketplace 1.0) to building trust (e.g., Airbnb) to owning logistics or underwriting risk (e.g., DoorDash, Faire). The endpoint of this evolution is owning the supply entirely, transitioning out of a [[concepts/marketplace-strategy|marketplace model]] into a consolidated e-commerce or service model.
