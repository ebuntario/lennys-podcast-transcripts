Instead of committing to a podcast indefinitely, start with a single season of 8-10 episodes. This [[concepts/testing|experimentation]] approach allows you to validate your interest and the format's viability without long-term pressure. If the project doesn't resonate, you can conclude it gracefully as a completed season rather than an abandoned show.
