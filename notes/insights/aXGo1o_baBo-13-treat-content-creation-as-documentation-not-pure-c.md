A sustainable approach to creating content (like on TikTok or blogs) is to frame it as documenting your thought process and learnings from real work experiences. This makes the process more natural and less burdensome than treating each post as a novel creative act. This [[concepts/documentation|documentation mindset]] turns your daily work into a source of valuable, authentic insights for others.
