You can choose to shorten a [[concepts/feedback-loops|feedback loop]] by identifying leading indicators correlated with your desired long-term outcome. For example, a venture investor can forecast and track the probability of a Series A round, getting feedback in months rather than a decade. The loop is as long as you decide it to be.
