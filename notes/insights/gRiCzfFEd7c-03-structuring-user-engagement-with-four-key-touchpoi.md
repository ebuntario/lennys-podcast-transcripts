Establish a rhythm of engagement with key users through weekly demo days, collaborative working sessions, breaking news dress rehearsals, and office hours. This system ensures continuous feedback, builds trust, and helps evangelize the product. Framing sessions as collaborative "working sessions" rather than "user testing" fosters a more productive partnership.
