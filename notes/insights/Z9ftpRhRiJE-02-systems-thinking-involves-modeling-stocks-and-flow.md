[[concepts/systems-thinking|Systems thinking]] is a framework for understanding complex systems by identifying stocks (accumulated quantities) and flows (rates of change between them). For example, modeling a hiring pipeline reveals where candidates drop off, allowing targeted interventions. The key is to use the model to learn where reality conflicts with your assumptions, then update your mental model accordingly.
