Despite advances, AI cannot perform tasks like deriving fundamental physical laws from observational data or engaging in nuanced motivational conversations. These require [[concepts/scientific-discovery|abstract creativity]] and [[concepts/emotional-intelligence|deep emotional understanding]] that current systems do not possess. Acknowledging these [[concepts/ai-limitations|gaps]] is crucial for directing future research beyond mere scaling of existing models.
