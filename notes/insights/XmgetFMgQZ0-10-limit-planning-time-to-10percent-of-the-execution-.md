Avoid getting bogged down in over-planning by adhering to a 10% rule: don't spend more than 10% of an execution period on planning for it. For a one-week sprint, plan for half a day; for a quarter, plan for about a week. This rule respects the reality that you often don't know what's ahead until you launch and learn, maintaining [[concepts/agile-methodologies|agility]].
