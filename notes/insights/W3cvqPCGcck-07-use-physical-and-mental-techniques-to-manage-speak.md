Combat stage fright by using techniques like the "power pose" (hands on hips) to boost confidence chemically. Before the event, walk the empty stage to familiarize yourself with the space and visualize a receptive audience. During the talk, focus on a few engaged, nodding attendees in different parts of the room and speak directly to them to create a sense of supportive connection.
