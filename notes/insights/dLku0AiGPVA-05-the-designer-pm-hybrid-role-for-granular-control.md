A small, central design team acting as [[concepts/designer-pm|designer-PM hybrids]] can give a founder granular control over the product. These individuals own both design and product management work—roadmapping, specs, stakeholder coordination. This structure allows a CEO to meet with just a handful of people to understand every user-impacting change, maintaining a tight grip on the product direction and innovation pace.
