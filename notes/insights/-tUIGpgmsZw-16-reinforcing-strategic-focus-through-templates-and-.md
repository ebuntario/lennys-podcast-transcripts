Instilling a culture of focus requires reinforcing mechanisms beyond just stating it as a value. Embed the focus on target customers into operational templates—for OPA documents, PRDs, and product review presentations. Consistently asking "Who is the target user?" and "How do we solve their needs better than alternatives?" in these artifacts hardwires the strategic focus into daily decision-making.
