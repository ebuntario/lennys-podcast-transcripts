Start every major project with a vision deck that moves from abstract "chaos" (ideas, problems, beliefs) to concrete "clarity." The first step is simply writing the idea down, then progressively adding slides, designs, and prototypes. This [[concepts/visual-communication|visual communication]] makes the amorphous tangible, allowing teams to collectively see and work towards willing the vision into existence.
