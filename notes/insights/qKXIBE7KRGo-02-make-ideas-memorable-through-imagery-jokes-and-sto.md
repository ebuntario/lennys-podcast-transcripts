To make an idea spread, make it memorable and give people a reason to repeat it voluntarily. Use techniques like creating a vivid mental image (e.g., "binders of women"), turning it into a repeatable joke, or using a concrete story instead of subjective adjectives. The goal is to minimize the cognitive burden on the recipient so the idea is easily understood and shared.
