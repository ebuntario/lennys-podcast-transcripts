Adopting a [[concepts/business-mindset|business owner's perspective]] helps detach emotionally from day-to-day metrics and make strategic decisions. This means focusing on sustainability, profitability, and building assets, not just subscriber counts. This mindset shift allows for better work-life boundaries and more objective planning for the future of the venture.
