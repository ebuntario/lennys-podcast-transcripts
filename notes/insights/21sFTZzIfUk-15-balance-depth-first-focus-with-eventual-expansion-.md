While a depth-first focus is critical for initial [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]], eventually you must expand to meet the broader governance needs of enterprise buyers. For Snyk, this meant adding support for additional languages and ecosystems and building "table stakes" features like reporting and robust user management. This expansion was necessary because security teams are accountable for securing entire application estates with diversified tech stacks, and a narrow focus wouldn't meet their needs, unlocking the next phase of growth.
