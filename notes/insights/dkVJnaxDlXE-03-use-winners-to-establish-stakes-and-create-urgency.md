To create emotional stakes, show that winners are already playing the new game you're describing. This demonstrates the shift is real and creates urgency by framing the future as a choice between a negative outcome (staying in the old game) and a positive one (adopting the new). This moves prospects from reluctant to engaged by making the choice feel consequential.
