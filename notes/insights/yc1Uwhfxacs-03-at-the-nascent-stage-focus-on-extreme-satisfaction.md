The goal of level one (nascent product-market fit) is to find three to five customers with a problem that is both important and urgent, and deliver a solution that creates extreme satisfaction. At this stage, it's acceptable—even advisable—to be highly inefficient (e.g., manual, Wizard-of-Oz solutions) if it uncovers what delivers "insanely good" customer value. Founders should prioritize learning and validation over scalable processes.
