For qualitative user interviews, the Nielsen number provides a useful guideline: you stop learning new things after interviewing between 7 and 14 people. Interviewing fewer than 7 means you haven't learned enough, while more than 14 yields diminishing returns. Starting with this structured approach prevents wasted effort and helps focus research on gaining sufficient insight without falling into the trap of endless, unproductive activity.
