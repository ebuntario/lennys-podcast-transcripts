Effective objectives should make team members excited to work on them each morning, not just describe what needs to be shipped. They should connect to larger [[concepts/strategic-alignment|strategic themes]] while being specific enough to guide decision-making. Avoid both overly fluffy objectives that lack direction and overly tactical ones that fail to inspire meaningful engagement.
