To be seen as a trusted expert, cultivate curiosity about how the entire company works. Understand your boss's and your boss's boss's priorities ("two levels up") and the technical or operational details of your work ("two levels down"). This holistic understanding allows you to connect your work to strategic goals and advise others, making you a go-to resource.
