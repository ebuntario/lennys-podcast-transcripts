When presenting options, use a visual grid with options as rows and evaluation criteria (e.g., legal, UX, feasibility) as columns. Color-code each cell red, yellow, or green based on performance against that criterion. This framework provides immediate, [[concepts/decision-making|visual clarity]] on trade-offs and allows different functions to contribute their perspective to a shared evaluation structure.
