[[concepts/single-threaded-leadership|Single-threaded leadership]] moves teams from project-based to program-based orientation with dedicated resources. This structure eliminates resource contention debates and allows teams to focus on improving their specific metrics. Leaders have clear ownership over outcomes while senior management only needs to decide resource allocation periodically rather than refereeing daily roadmap conflicts.
