Thriving as a product leader alongside a strong-opinionated founder requires adaptability and the ability to engage in informed, respectful debate. The key is ensuring the founder is willing to be challenged and that you build a deep foundation of mutual respect. Being a "moldable puzzle piece" who can fit into the unique dynamics of the relationship is a critical skill.
