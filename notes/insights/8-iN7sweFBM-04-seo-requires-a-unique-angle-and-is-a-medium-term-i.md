To vet an SEO opportunity, check if you have a unique editorial angle, a programmatic angle (like templates), or a unique data angle. If you can check two of these three boxes, you may be in good shape. SEO has a longer return horizon (6+ months), so it's crucial to time-box experimentation to about three months to assess early signals before making a larger commitment.
