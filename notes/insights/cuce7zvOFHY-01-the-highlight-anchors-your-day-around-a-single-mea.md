Start your day by asking: "If someone asked me at the end of the day, 'What was the highlight?' what would I want to say?" This single question shifts your focus from managing a to-do list to creating a meaningful moment. The highlight can be based on urgency, satisfaction, or joy, and serves as the anchor for your energy and attention, making everything else feel secondary.
