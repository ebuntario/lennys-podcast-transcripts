For a marketplace, [[concepts/liquidity|liquidity]]—defined as the reliability for a user to complete their intended transaction—is the most critical early metric. It should be expressed in customer-centric terms, such as wait time for ride-sharing or search conversion rate for e-commerce. Until a marketplace achieves liquidity in a focused area (like a specific geography or category), scaling efforts and other metrics are largely irrelevant.
