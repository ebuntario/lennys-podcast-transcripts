Adopting evidence-guided practices doesn't require a full, immediate overhaul. Diagnose where your biggest problem lies: if goals are unclear, start with defining North Star Metrics and metrics trees. If you're stuck in opinion battles, implement ICE scoring and the confidence meter. If you're building too much without learning, introduce a validation ladder. This targeted, incremental approach prevents change fatigue and allows for sustainable improvement.
