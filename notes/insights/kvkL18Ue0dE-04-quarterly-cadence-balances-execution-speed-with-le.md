Quarterly OKRs create an optimal rhythm for execution—long enough to accomplish meaningful work but short enough to remember what was done. This cadence enables [[concepts/learning-cycles|learning cycles]] where teams can assess progress, identify obstacles, and apply insights to the next quarter. The regular review process builds organizational knowledge over time rather than resetting with each planning cycle.
