Building teams as complementary organisms where members know each other's strengths and weaknesses creates more value than assembling individuals with perfect pedigrees. For most roles (excluding ~5% where specific experience is critical), hiring should focus on three attributes: curious problem-solving ability, capacity to work across people with humility, and leadership potential. This approach allows teams to grow together through scale phases, as demonstrated by the Uber Eats management team that scaled from zero to $20 billion together.
