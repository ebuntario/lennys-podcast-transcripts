Deciding whether to improve a weakness or double down on a strength depends entirely on your personal and professional goals. If a skill is necessary to achieve an outcome you desire, you should work on it; if not, you can deprioritize it. Effective [[concepts/career-development|career growth]] comes from aligning your skill-building efforts with your specific ambitions, not from blindly following generic advancement paths.
