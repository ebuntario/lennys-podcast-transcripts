Early-stage companies should practice ruthless prioritization on the one tactic that's delivering the majority of user acquisition, even if it creates over-reliance. Diversification is a distraction when total acquisition is still small. Later-stage companies with significant revenue (e.g., $50M+ ARR) that are overly reliant on a single channel should carve out resources to explore others and mitigate risk.
