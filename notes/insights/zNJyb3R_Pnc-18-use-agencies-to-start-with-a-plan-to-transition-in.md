Agencies or consultants are a good way to start paid efforts when you lack expertise or bandwidth. However, establish clear milestones (e.g., at $50K/month spend) for bringing someone in-house. A good partner will support this transition, as their goal should be your success, not just retaining you as a client indefinitely.
