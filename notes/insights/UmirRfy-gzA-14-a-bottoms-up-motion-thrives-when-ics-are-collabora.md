The [[concepts/bottom-up-growth|bottom-up growth]] model is supercharged when your core user (e.g., a designer) has a job that requires collaboration with many roles (PMs, engineers). This natural workflow makes them "super-spreaders" within an organization. Evaluate if your target [[concepts/product-led-growth|product-led growth]] audience has inherent connection points that facilitate organic spread.
