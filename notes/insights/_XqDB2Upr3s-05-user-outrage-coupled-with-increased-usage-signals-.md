When launching a major new feature like News Feed, pay attention to the delta between stated user preferences (outrage) and revealed preferences (doubled usage). This cognitive dissonance can indicate the core product is right, even if execution details are wrong. The key is diagnosing whether the *thing itself* is flawed or just the *implementation details*.
