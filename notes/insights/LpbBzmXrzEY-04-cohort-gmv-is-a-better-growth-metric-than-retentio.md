For businesses with [[concepts/power-law-distribution|power-law monetization]] (where a few highly successful users generate most revenue), cohort Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) over 3-5 years is a more meaningful metric than traditional retention rates. This approach acknowledges that many attempts will fail, but the winners make the entire cohort valuable. It shifts focus from preventing all churn to maximizing the success potential of those who will become power users.
