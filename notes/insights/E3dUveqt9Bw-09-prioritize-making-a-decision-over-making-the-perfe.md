[[concepts/decision-making|Decision-making]] speed is critical; it's better to make a 70% right decision than to wait for perfect information. Committing to a decision based on a strong hypothesis generates real-world feedback, moving you out of the hypothetical. This approach values [[concepts/experimentation|learning and iteration]] over analysis paralysis, as you can adjust the remaining 30% based on new, high-fidelity data.
