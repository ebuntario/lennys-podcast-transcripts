A key insight from working inside large organizations is that internal data is often locked in systems with opaque schemas (e.g., SAP tables named "S3_F1_Z"). Palantir's breakthrough was creating an "ontology"—a layer that maps these technical tables to human-understandable concepts like "aircraft," "work order," or "part." This [[concepts/data-integration|data integration]] work, which became a core product feature, unlocks value by making data legible and actionable for business users.
