Transform engineers into [[concepts/product-engineers|product engineers]] by giving them direct exposure to a small set of lighthouse users. When engineers know customers by name, understand their problems, and see the impact of their work, they develop deep empathy and intrinsic motivation to solve the right problems. This creates a powerful, unified product team where everyone advocates for the customer.
