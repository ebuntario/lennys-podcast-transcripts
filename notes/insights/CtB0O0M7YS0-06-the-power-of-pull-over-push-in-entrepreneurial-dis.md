Having unstructured time allows you to double down on signals of strong audience interest, or "pull." When a piece of content receives disproportionate engagement, it's a signal to explore that topic more deeply. This method of following [[concepts/audience-feedback|audience pull]] is often more effective than pushing a pre-conceived idea and hoping it finds a market.
