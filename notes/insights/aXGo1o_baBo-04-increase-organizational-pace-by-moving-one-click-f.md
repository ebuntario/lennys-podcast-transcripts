To accelerate a team's [[concepts/operational-tempo|clock speed]], set the expectation that all deadlines should be pulled in by one iteration (e.g., this year becomes this half, this week becomes today). This tangible tactic forces a re-evaluation of what's truly urgent and breaks the habit of letting meeting cadences dictate action timelines. Leaders must model this by maintaining a fast personal SLA to avoid becoming a bottleneck.
