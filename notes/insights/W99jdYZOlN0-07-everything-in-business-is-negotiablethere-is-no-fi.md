Early experiences with investors who constantly changed deal terms revealed that business operates without fixed rules—everything is negotiable if you can align incentives and imagine new possibilities.

Recognizing this reality early creates resilience when facing established entities that themselves operate without consistent playbooks, as demonstrated when entertainment associations sued for a quarter trillion dollars but settled for $1 million.
