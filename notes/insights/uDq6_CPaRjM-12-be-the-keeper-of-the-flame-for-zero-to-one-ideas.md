Leading a zero-to-one project is like being the keeper of a flame—it's your job to stoke the embers when they risk dying out and to spread the idea like wildfire. This requires optimism that borders on delusion, translating "no" into "not yet," and being scrappy to make early pitches feel real (e.g., swapping an icon in a hackathon demo). Use company-wide forums to turn your evangelism into collective momentum.
