Building programmatic, SEO-optimized assets can serve as powerful, scalable [[concepts/acquisition|acquisition loops]]. For example, Snyk created Snyk Advisor, a service that indexes package managers, augments data with security scans and maintenance activity, and generates hundreds of thousands of automated package pages that rank highly in search. These company-generated, company-distributed content assets bring in high-intent traffic and include CTAs to join Snyk, functioning as a perpetual acquisition engine.
