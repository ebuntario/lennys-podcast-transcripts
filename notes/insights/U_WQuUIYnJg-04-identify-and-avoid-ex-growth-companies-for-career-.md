An "ex-growth" company is one that raised substantial capital during the hypergrowth era but is now struggling to find sustainable [[concepts/product-market-fit|product market fit]] while still carrying a high valuation. The signs are: the core product is being reframed, there's a struggle to find strong customer pull, and the valuation doesn't match the pre-PMF reality. For employees, staying often means your equity may be worthless and you're taking a significant opportunity cost; it's generally a company to leave.
