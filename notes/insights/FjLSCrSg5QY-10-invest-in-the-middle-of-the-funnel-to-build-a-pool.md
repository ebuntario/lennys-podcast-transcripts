Most budgets focus on top-of-funnel (awareness) and bottom-of-funnel (conversion), but the biggest opportunity is expanding the middle. Building a pool of engaged, aware leads—through tactics like [[concepts/freemium-model|freemium]] products or niche inbound media (podcasts, video series)—allows prospects to convert on their own timeline. Leads from this pool have 10-20% higher retention and double the NPS because they opt-in when *they* are ready.
