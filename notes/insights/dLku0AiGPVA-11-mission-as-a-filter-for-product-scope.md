Use a clear company mission as a strict filter for what to build. If a potential product or feature falls outside the mission, do not pursue it, no matter how exciting or popular it seems. This focus prevents distraction and ensures all efforts align with the core problem you're solving. It also protects the company's values and user experience from misaligned incentives.
