In Apple's model, product development is driven by designers and engineers tinkering and crafting, rather than by strategic planners analyzing markets. This [[concepts/design-led-development|design-led approach]] focuses on what feels right and builds beautiful, functional products. It contrasts with more metric-driven, strategy-heavy cultures common at other tech companies.
