When building a high-growth team, prioritize candidates with high raw cognitive capability and a [[concepts/startup-mindset|startup mindset]]—people who care deeply about the product, users, and team dynamics. Look for individuals who are more interested in moving fast and understanding the whole business than in perfecting a single craft. This generalist, owner-like mentality is crucial for scaling with a small team.
