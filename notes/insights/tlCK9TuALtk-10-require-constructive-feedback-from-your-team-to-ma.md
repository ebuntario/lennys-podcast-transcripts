Dedicate time in one-on-ones to first solicit constructive feedback for yourself, and press for it if it's not given. This creates a safe, reciprocal space for [[concepts/feedback|giving feedback]] and normalizes tough conversations. Leaders must then visibly act on the feedback and report back, closing the loop to show it's valued.
