A [[concepts/feature-teams|feature team]] is given a roadmap of features (output) to design, build, and deploy, often with set deadlines. In contrast, an [[concepts/product-teams|empowered product team]] is given problems to solve and is measured on delivering valuable outcomes, not just shipping features. This fundamental shift from output to outcomes is the core difference between delivery-focused and value-focused organizations.
