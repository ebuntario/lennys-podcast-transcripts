Founders should understand that investors have limited capacity for investments each year and must choose only the opportunities they're most excited about. A rejection often means "this isn't the one I want to bet on" rather than indicating fundamental problems with the [[concepts/fundraising|fundraising]] pitch or business model. Putting yourself in the investor's shoes—with limited shots to take—makes their decision-making more understandable.
