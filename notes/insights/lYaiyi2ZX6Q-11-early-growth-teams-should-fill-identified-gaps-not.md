An early [[concepts/growth-team|growth team]] is most effective when tasked with solving known, specific gaps in the user journey, such as improving SMS delivery rates or first-time user education. They act as a "cleanup crew" that connects dots the core product team hasn't addressed, rather than being expected to model an entirely new growth strategy from zero.
