An [[concepts/success-metrics|Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC)]] should be causally predictive of long-term user value, not just short-term revenue. It often involves a constraint optimization problem, balancing a primary goal (e.g., revenue) with guardrail metrics (e.g., user experience) to ensure sustainable growth.
