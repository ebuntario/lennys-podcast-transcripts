A [[concepts/strategy-salon|strategy salon]] (or nerd club) is a secret, opt-in group with enforced "yes, and" norms and [[concepts/psychological-safety|psychological safety]]. By dribbling in diverse perspectives and letting participants build on what they find interesting, the group [[concepts/idea-generation|stochastically generates]] powerful insights. These forums are valuable for low-stakes exploration of half-formed ideas that can later influence formal strategy.
