Strong [[concepts/founder-conviction|founder conviction]] typically develops over time as customer feedback and data validate the business direction. Founders shouldn't expect unwavering certainty from day one—initial belief strengthens as products gain traction and users provide positive reinforcement. This evolving confidence creates a virtuous cycle where founders' increasing belief attracts more resources and team commitment.
