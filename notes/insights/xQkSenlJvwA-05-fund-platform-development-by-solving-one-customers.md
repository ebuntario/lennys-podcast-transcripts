Palantir's model involved going deep to solve a single large customer's multi-million dollar problem. The customer paid for the outcome, which funded the development of the solution. Generalizable components from that solution were then folded into the core platform (Foundry or Gotham). This turns [[concepts/customer-funding|customer funding]] into a powerful engine for [[concepts/product-strategy|product strategy]] and platform development.
