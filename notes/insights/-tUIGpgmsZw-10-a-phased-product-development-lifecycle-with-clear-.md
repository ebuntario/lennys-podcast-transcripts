A disciplined product development lifecycle involves distinct phases: Discovery, Solutioning, Build, and Launch/Measure/Iterate. Teams commit to dates only for work within their immediate control, like a discovery effort or solution design phase. This avoids premature commitments on projects months out and allows for better estimation only after a solution is defined, leading to more reliable delivery timelines.
