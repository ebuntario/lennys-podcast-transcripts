Treat SEO like [[concepts/product-development|product development]] with clear milestones: ideation, PRD creation, engineering work, and launch. Measure progress against these milestones rather than immediate traffic gains. Some initiatives show quick results (like Quora's changes), while others take years (like Zapier's integration pages) depending on search demand.
