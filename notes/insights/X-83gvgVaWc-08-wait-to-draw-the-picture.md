Resist the urge to create high-resolution visuals or prototypes too early in the process. The first visual mark—the "primal mark"—sets a baseline that everyone latches onto, prematurely narrowing possibilities. Instead, stay in conceptual, conversational, or [[concepts/low-fidelity-prototyping|low-fidelity]] spaces (like block diagrams) to explore second, third, and fourth ideas without getting bogged down in feedback about colors and shapes.
