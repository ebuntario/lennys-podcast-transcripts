When prioritizing projects, evaluate them through the lens of your organization's ultimate mission, not just immediate business metrics. For instance, a feature might drive revenue, but the critical question is whether that revenue ultimately fuels progress toward the core goal. This ensures resources are allocated to work that creates fundamental, not just incremental, value.
