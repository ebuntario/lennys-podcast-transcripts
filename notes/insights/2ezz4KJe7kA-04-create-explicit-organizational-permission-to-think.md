Thinking big is difficult and often gets deprioritized by day-to-day urgency. Companies must create explicit cultural moments and processes that grant permission for strategic thinking. Examples include adding a "Think Bigger" section to team charters asking what they'd do with 20% more time, or an annual "Crazy Ideas" document soliciting high-risk, high-reward concepts from the entire organization.
