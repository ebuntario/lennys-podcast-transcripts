When a leader's desired outcome isn't achieved, there are only three root causes. The person involved either **can't do** it (a capability issue), **won't do** it (a motivation or alignment issue), or **was not set up to do** it (a leadership failure in establishing proper [[concepts/team-setup|ways of working]]). Diagnosing which of these three applies is the first step to effective [[concepts/performance-management|performance management]] and resolution.
