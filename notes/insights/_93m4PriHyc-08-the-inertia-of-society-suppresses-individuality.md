A fundamental human conflict exists between the need for love/acceptance and the need to express one's unique individuality. Society conditions individuals from a young age to conform to shared beliefs, often causing people to suppress their true selves to gain acceptance. Personal transformation requires consciously rejecting this conditioning and reclaiming one's individuality, despite the fear of rejection.
