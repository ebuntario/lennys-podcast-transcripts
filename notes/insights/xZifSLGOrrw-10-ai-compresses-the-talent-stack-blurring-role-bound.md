Powerful AI tools like coding agents compress the talent stack, enabling individuals to accomplish tasks that previously required specialized roles or team coordination. For example, designers can vibe-code prototypes, PMs can analyze data by having an agent build interactive viewers, and marketers can make string changes directly. This blurs traditional role boundaries, reduces communication overhead, and dramatically increases individual [[concepts/productivity|impact]] and speed.
