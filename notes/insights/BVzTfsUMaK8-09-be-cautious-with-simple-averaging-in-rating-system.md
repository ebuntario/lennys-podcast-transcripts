Using a simple average for ratings has significant distributional consequences: it heavily penalizes new entrants with few reviews and makes established players' scores nearly immutable. Consider incorporating a prior belief (like a Bayesian average) to give newcomers a fairer starting point and mitigate the massive downside risk of a single early negative review.
