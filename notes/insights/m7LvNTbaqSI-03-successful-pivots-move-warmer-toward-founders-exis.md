Effective [[concepts/pivoting|pivots]] build upon what founders have learned from previous attempts and leverage their unique knowledge. Examples like Brex pivoting from VR headsets to fintech (based on prior Brazilian fintech experience) and Retool moving from peer-to-peer payments to internal tools demonstrate how successful pivots get closer to founders' core competencies rather than venturing into unfamiliar territory.
