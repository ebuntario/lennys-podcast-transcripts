High-risk, high-reward innovation requires embracing failure as a natural outcome. A culture that promotes "ship fast, ship early, ship often" understands that most attempts won't go right initially. The goal is to learn quickly from failures, change direction, and improve, rather than avoiding mistakes altogether. This creates a tension with quality standards but is essential for meaningful [[concepts/testing|experimentation]] and breakthrough innovation.
