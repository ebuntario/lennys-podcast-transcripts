The [[concepts/growth-competency|growth competency model]] consists of four key areas: growth execution, customer knowledge, growth strategy, and communication/influence. The goal isn't to find a unicorn excelling in all areas, but to build a well-rounded team that covers these competencies collectively. This framework helps in [[concepts/hiring-frameworks|hiring]], performance evaluation, and identifying skill gaps within a growth organization.
