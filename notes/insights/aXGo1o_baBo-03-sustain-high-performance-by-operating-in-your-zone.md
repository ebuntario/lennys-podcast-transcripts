Long-term sustainability comes from focusing on work that energizes you and where you deliver exceptional, differentiated value. Conduct an "energy audit" by categorizing your tasks to identify what you love and what drains you, then actively seek to do more of the former. Leaning into your [[concepts/strengths|strengths]] and unique contributions is more effective than trying to improve weaknesses.
