As a CEO, your casual comments carry disproportionate weight and can unintentionally redirect team priorities. Even when you frame feedback as "just one person's opinion," team members often interpret it as a directive. Effective leadership requires understanding this dynamic and calibrating your engagement to avoid micromanaging while still providing strategic direction.
