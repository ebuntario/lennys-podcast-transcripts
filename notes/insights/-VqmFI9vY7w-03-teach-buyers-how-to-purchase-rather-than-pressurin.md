When buyers are indecisive, emphasizing fear of missing out (FOMO) actually decreases conversion rates by adding more stress. Instead, help buyers navigate the purchasing process by explaining different market approaches and what constitutes a good solution for their situation. This [[concepts/sales-education|teaching approach]] reduces anxiety and builds trust as you become a helpful advisor rather than just another vendor.
