A robust product process has two core inputs: building towards a long-term mission and actively listening to explicit community requests. Systematically tallying and acting on user feedback ensures you build features people love and need. Couple this with continuous [[concepts/user-testing|user testing]] to observe real behavior, as watching even ten people struggle can reveal friction points representative of a much larger audience.
