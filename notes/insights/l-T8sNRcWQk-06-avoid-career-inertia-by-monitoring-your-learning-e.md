Don't be the frog in slowly boiling water; regularly assess if your role still offers growth and challenge. If learning stagnates or the environment trends negatively, take agency through conversations with leadership or side projects. Staying in a role should be a conscious choice based on continued development, not [[concepts/inertia|inertia]] or the hope that things will improve.
