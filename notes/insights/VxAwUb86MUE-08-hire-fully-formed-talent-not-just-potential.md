Hire people who are already fully capable of doing the job you need, rather than hiring for potential with the hope of coaching them. If you find yourself questioning whether to fire someone even once, it's a strong signal to let them go immediately. For leadership roles, listen carefully to their past experiences—people will gravitate toward strategies they know, so hire a CEO whose natural approach aligns with your business's needs.
