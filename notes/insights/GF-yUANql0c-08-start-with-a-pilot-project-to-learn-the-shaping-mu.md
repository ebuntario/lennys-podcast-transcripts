To adopt Shape Up, choose a meaningful but bounded pilot project that the team cares about, ideally with a time box of three to six weeks. Assemble the key roles (product, senior engineer, design) for collaborative shaping sessions. The goal is to learn the new collaborative rhythm and prove the value of finishing something concrete on time, creating momentum for broader change.
