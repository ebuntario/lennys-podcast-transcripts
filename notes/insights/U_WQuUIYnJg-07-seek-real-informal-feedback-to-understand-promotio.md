Formal feedback systems often miss the ground truth about why you're not advancing. To get real feedback, you must create psychological safety and actively pull for candid insights from peers and others. Develop strong listening skills—avoid justifying or defending yourself when receiving feedback. A powerful technique is to repeat the feedback back to the giver, demonstrating you've understood and value their perspective, which encourages more openness.
