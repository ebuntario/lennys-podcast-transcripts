Instead of asking for estimates on an undefined project, set a time-box (appetite) as the input. Explore what could be done in different timeframes (e.g., 4, 6, or 8 weeks) to find the efficient frontier of cost and impact. This [[concepts/project-scoping|project scoping]] technique forces teams to identify the core problem and peel away non-essential requirements first.
