Use a [[concepts/fear-setting|fear-setting]] exercise to move forward by explicitly writing down your fears and how you could mitigate them. The most powerful part is calculating the cost of *inaction*—what you lose by staying in your current state. This reframe often reveals that the hidden costs of not changing (like drained creativity or lost aliveness) are greater than the risks of trying something new.
