When defining what makes a good PM, separate personality traits from skills. Traits like [[concepts/product-mindset|curiosity]] and empathy are foundational and very hard to develop in a corporate setting, so you should hire for them. While you can help someone build the muscle of empathy, it's nearly impossible to coach someone to a seasoned level if they lack a decent baseline of these core traits.
