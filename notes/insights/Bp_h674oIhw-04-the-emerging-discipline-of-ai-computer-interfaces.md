Optimizing tools for [[concepts/ai-agents|AI agents]] requires a new discipline distinct from human-computer interaction. Effective [[concepts/ai-interfaces|AI-computer interfaces]] provide agents with structured, textual representations of systems (like shells or editors) rather than forcing them to parse visual pixels. This specialized interface design is crucial for reliable, cost-effective agent performance.
