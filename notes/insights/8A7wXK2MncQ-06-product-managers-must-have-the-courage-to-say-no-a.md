There is immense pressure to scale a product once the company is excited about it. A key role of the product manager is to resist scaling until the product is truly great, using metrics like the Sean Ellis Score as evidence. Scaling a small problem creates a big mess. It's better to iterate and fix issues at small scale than to pour resources into a "leaky bucket."
