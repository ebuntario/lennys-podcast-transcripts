To garner trust and win over skeptics, especially when you're less experienced, focus on bringing valuable insight to every conversation. Deeply know your customer, market, competitors, numbers, and product. This [[concepts/credibility|credibility]] comes from doing the work to understand the problem space, not from pretending to have more experience than you do. Being the person who can confidently share a well-informed point of view makes others curious and builds trust organically.
