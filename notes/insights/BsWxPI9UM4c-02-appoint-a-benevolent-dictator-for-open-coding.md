To avoid committee paralysis during error analysis, appoint a single "benevolent dictator" whose taste and domain expertise you trust. This person—often the product manager or a domain expert—should be responsible for the initial open coding to keep the process tractable and fast. The goal is to make progress, not achieve perfection through consensus.
