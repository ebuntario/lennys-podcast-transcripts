Experts can now monetize their knowledge directly by helping train AI models, earning significantly more than traditional academic side jobs. For example, a PhD in physics might earn $150-$200 per hour identifying model failures, compared to $25 as a teaching assistant. This creates a new [[concepts/income-streams|high-value income stream]] for advanced degree holders and integrates their expertise directly into AI advancement.
