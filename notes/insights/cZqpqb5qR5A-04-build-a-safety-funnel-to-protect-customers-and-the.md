When innovating within a successful product, use a [[concepts/safety-funnel|safety funnel]] strategy. Initially build and test new experiences in a controlled, separate environment to avoid disrupting existing customers. Gradually expose the feature to more users only after proving its value and stability, which protects the core business's reputation and allows for iterative refinement.
