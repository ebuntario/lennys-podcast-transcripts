The rise of consumption-based and AI-driven business models has shifted sales from transactional to deeply consultative. Buyers often know they need to change but don't know how. Sales teams must now lean into the "art of the possible," acting as consultants who help customers think through their problems, architect solutions, and demonstrate tangible value, often through collaborative sessions like whiteboarding architecture diagrams.
