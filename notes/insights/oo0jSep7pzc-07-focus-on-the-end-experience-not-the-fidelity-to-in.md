A key lesson from creative industries like animation is that what matters is the end experience and emotion delivered to the user, not whether the internal process or model is "correct" or "real." Apply this to product development: the strategy document or framework is just an input; the ultimate goal is solving real customer problems and creating the desired outcome.
