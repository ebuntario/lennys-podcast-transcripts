Friction can be a useful feature when applied to shape positive user behavior and communication culture. For example, Slack's "shouty rooster" warning before using @everyone made users consider the cost of their action, reducing notification spam. This thoughtful friction educates users on how the product works best and prevents negative patterns like the tragedy of the commons.
