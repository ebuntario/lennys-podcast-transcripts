When working on [[concepts/algorithmic-products|algorithmic products]], a core product manager responsibility is to define what the algorithm should be responsible for versus what people are responsible for. Algorithms often don't understand long-term effects, user responses, or strategic intent, so product managers must design the framework for human judgment and control. This involves creating interfaces that allow people to make strategic decisions and then letting the algorithm amplify that intent.
