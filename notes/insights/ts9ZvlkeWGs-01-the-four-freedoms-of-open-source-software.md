The [[concepts/gpl-license|GPL license]] grants four essential freedoms: the freedom to use the software for any purpose, the freedom to study how it works, the freedom to change it, and the freedom to redistribute those changes. This viral license ensures that anyone you share the software with receives the same freedoms, creating a foundation for collaborative development and user liberty.
