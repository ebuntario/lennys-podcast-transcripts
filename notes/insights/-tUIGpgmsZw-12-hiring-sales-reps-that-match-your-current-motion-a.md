When building an initial sales team on top of a PLG foundation, hire sales reps whose background matches the inbound, product-qualified lead (PQL) motion and the current target buyer (e.g., department heads). Avoid hiring heavy outbound "hunters" accustomed to selling to CIOs too early. The sales profile should evolve as the business matures and the target buyer shifts upmarket.
