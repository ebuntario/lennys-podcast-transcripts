To help someone recognize they are in an unproductive emotional state like anger or fear, use a non-accusatory "I" statement. Saying "I perceive you to be in anger" is more effective than "You're in anger" or "Are you in anger?" This approach minimizes defensiveness and allows the person to become aware and shift their state without feeling attacked.
