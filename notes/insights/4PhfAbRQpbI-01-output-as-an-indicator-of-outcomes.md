While focusing on [[concepts/outcome-driven-development|outcomes]] is critical, teams can swing too far and forget that output is a key indicator. A team can have perfect ideation, documentation, and briefs, but if they are not shipping things to market quickly enough, the outcomes-focused work doesn't matter. Velocity of execution is a necessary component for achieving meaningful results.
