For social or community products, introducing intentional friction (like a detailed questionnaire to join a group) can help [[concepts/user-segmentation|segment users]] based on the depth of their intent. Users willing to overcome the hurdle signal a stronger desire for that specific experience, allowing the product to tailor their journey and surface more relevant paths.
