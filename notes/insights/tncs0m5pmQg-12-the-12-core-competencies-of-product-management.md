Effective product management rests on 12 competencies across four areas: Product Execution (specs, delivery, quality), Customer Insight (data, voice of customer, UX design), Product Strategy (owning outcomes, vision/roadmapping, strategic impact), and Leadership (stakeholder inclusion, team leadership, managing up). These areas remain constant from APM to CPO, though the scope of application changes from individual contribution to building systems.
