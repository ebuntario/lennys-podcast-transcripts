When prioritizing work, estimate impact using the same unit of measure as your team's primary goal, not an abstract scoring system. For a goal of converting users, estimate how many users each initiative could potentially convert. This practice, called [[concepts/impact-estimation|impact estimation]], keeps prioritization honest and surfaces the high-effort, high-certainty work that might actually move the needle versus smaller, safer tasks.
