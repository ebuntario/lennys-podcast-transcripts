Prioritize "coming alive over getting ahead" as a guiding principle for career and life decisions. This motto emphasizes seeking personal energy, connection, and aliveness in your work rather than chasing external validation, prestige, or achievement. It serves as a filter for opportunities, helping you reject paths that offer traditional success but would drain your spirit.
