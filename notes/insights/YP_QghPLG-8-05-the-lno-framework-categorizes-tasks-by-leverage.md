Tasks fall into three categories: Leverage (L), where effort yields 10x-100x impact; Neutral (N), where input roughly equals output; and Overhead (O), where you get back far less than you put in. Most people treat all tasks equally, but you should intentionally focus energy on L tasks, reduce time on N tasks, and minimize or offload O tasks. The same activity (like writing notes) can be L, N, or O depending on context.
