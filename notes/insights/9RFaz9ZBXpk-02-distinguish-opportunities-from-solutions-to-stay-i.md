Effective product work requires staying in the [[concepts/problem-space|problem space]] before jumping to solutions, though this contradicts how our brains are naturally wired. Most people mistakenly write opportunities as solutions—for example, "improve search" is a solution, while "I can't find movies I want to watch" is the underlying opportunity. Framing opportunities as specific, customer-centric needs enables teams to address solvable problems rather than vague aspirations.
