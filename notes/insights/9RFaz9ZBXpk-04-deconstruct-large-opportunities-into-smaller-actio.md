Move vertically down the opportunity tree to break large, evergreen problems into smaller, addressable opportunities. For example, "I can't decide what to watch" can be deconstructed into "I don't know if this show is good" and further into "I want to know who's in the cast." This [[concepts/opportunity-decomposition|decomposition]] enables a continuous discovery cadence, allowing teams to solve specific customer needs while still contributing to larger business outcomes.
