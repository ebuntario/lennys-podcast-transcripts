Effective messaging reflects the language customers use to describe their struggles and desired outcomes, not the features you find most impressive. By anchoring your [[concepts/customer-messaging|messaging]] in the [[concepts/jobs-to-be-done|customer's job to be done]], you demonstrate understanding and show your product is the vehicle to their "better life," which significantly increases resonance and conversion.
