Adopting an improv mindset of "Yes, and..." helps teams progress by accepting and building upon each other's contributions rather than shutting them down. This approach is especially valuable in [[concepts/team-collaboration|cross-functional collaboration]], where different teams may have conflicting priorities or perspectives. By acknowledging that multiple truths can coexist, you foster better rapport, energy, and ultimately more effective solutions.
