Create a [[concepts/customer-journey-mapping|customer journey map]] that visualizes the story of how a customer meets and gets value from your product, focusing on their emotional state and life context. Frame the journey around key [[concepts/value-milestones|value milestones]] (like first value and value realization) rather than business stages (like MQL), which aligns teams and focuses efforts on delivering customer value.
