The work of a meeting is not calling it, but defining its purpose with extreme clarity. At the start, explicitly state the objective: Is it to make a decision, share information, or brainstorm? Declare who the [[concepts/decision-making|decision-maker]] is and how the decision will be made. This practice eliminates ambiguity, respects attendees' time, and transforms [[concepts/meetings|meetings]] from time sinks into productive engines.
