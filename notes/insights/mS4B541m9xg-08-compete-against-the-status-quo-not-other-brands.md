In [[concepts/category-design|category design]], you do not compete directly against other products or brands. Instead, you compete against the status quo—the current way of doing things that has a problem. For example, Peloton didn't attack other exercise bikes; it attacked the inconvenience of going to the gym. This strategy, called "damning the demand," redirects existing demand toward your new category by reframing the core problem and offering a fundamentally better alternative.
