The [[concepts/product-market-fit|Sean Ellis Score]] is a simple but powerful metric: ask users how disappointed they would be if your product went away. A strong signal of product-market fit is when at least 40% (or higher, adjusting for cultural norms) say they would be "very disappointed." Nubank uses this as a gate before scaling any product, ensuring they only invest in features customers truly love.
