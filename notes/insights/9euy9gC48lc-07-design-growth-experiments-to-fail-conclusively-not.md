The real failure in experimentation is not learning, not simply a negative result. To learn, you must design tests to fail conclusively by maximizing the treatment effect—throwing all plausible tactics at a hypothesis. This prevents the same idea from being retried for years due to ambiguous past results. In B2B where sample sizes are small, this approach provides clear evidence to either pursue optimization or abandon the hypothesis entirely.
