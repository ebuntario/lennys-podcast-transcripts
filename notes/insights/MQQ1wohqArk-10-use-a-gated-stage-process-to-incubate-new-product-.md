A stage-gate process (e.g., Wonder, Explore, Make, Impact, Scale) allows new product ideas to be validated with increasing levels of investment. Start with just an individual (Wonder), then add a few people to build a prototype and roadmap (Explore), before committing a full team (Make). This [[concepts/innovation|structured innovation]] approach provides frequent checkpoints to iterate or kill ideas quickly, mimicking a startup mindset within a large company.
