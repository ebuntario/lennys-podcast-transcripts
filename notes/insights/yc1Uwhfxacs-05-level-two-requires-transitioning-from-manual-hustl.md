Developing product-market fit (level two) involves scaling from ~5 to ~25 satisfied customers. The key shift is moving beyond founder-led hustle to developing a repeatable, scalable demand channel (e.g., tuned cold outreach, content, partnerships). Success here is signaled when the marginal customer becomes easier to acquire and you see early signs of organic inbound interest.
