For AI features, functional prototypes are far more valuable than PRDs or decks. The "proof is in the pudding"—you need to experience the interaction, latency, and edge cases directly. An interactive demo allows you to test unrealistic scenarios and feel the product experience, which is impossible to capture in static documentation.
