A powerful hiring hack is a written screen with biographical and situational questions (e.g., "Tell me about something you've built"). This filters for candidates with high "give a shit," reveals their [[concepts/communication-skills|communication skills]] and attention to detail, and screens out those not serious about the role, as many won't complete it.
