When hiring in the AI era, prioritize a [[concepts/learning-culture|learning mindset]] and eagerness to embrace new tools over existing AI expertise. Block looks for college grads or veterans who are open to learning and optimizing their work with AI. Critical thinking and deep technical understanding remain more important than being a fully "AI-native" programmer at this stage.
