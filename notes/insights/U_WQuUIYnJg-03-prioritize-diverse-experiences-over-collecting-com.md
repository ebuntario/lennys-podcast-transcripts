While working at prestigious companies can be valuable, especially for executives needing scale experience, chasing logos for resume-building is a shallow pursuit. A more fulfilling and effective path is to seek a diverse set of experiences across different company stages (pre-product-market-fit, scaling, etc.) and problem types (consumer, B2B, inside/outside the building). This diversity makes you a better builder and is more likely to lead to career satisfaction.
