When you feel your identity or correctness is being threatened in a disagreement, your worst behavior emerges. Instead, cultivate genuine [[concepts/curiosity|curiosity]] about the other person's perspective. Responding with "Fascinating, tell me more about why you think that" disarms conflict, builds bridges, and often leads to better outcomes or a change in your own view.
