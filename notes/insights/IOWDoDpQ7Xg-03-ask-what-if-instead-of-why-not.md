When encountering a new idea, pessimistic people ask "why not" questions focused on limitations and problems. To be more innovative, cultivate an optimistic mindset by asking "what if" questions that explore possibilities and extend the curve of potential. This shift from problem-finding to [[concepts/possibility-exploration|possibility exploration]] is crucial for breakthrough thinking.
