Process is inherently [[concepts/variance-reduction|variance reducing]], implemented to raise standards and ensure consistency across an organization. However, this often comes at the cost of bringing down the most creative thinkers and highest performers who thrive without rigid structure. Leaders must be intentional about this trade-off, especially as companies scale, and consider providing "escape hatches" from standard processes for exceptional talent.
