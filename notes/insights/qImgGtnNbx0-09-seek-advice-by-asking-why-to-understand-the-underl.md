When soliciting advice, don't just accept recommendations; interrogate the reasoning by repeatedly asking "why?" This helps you uncover the anecdotal experience or [[concepts/first-principles-thinking|first-principles framework]] behind the advice, which is often extrapolated from a single data point. Understanding the "why" allows you to apply the insight with nuance and integrate it with other perspectives to form your own independent judgment.
