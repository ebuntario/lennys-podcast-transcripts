True [[concepts/product-taste|product taste]] involves discerning quality in ideas and principles before they prove successful, not just appreciating good design after the fact. This requires evaluating concepts separately from their social proof, catchy metaphors, or authority bias. Developing this discernment in belief formation fundamentally improves product leadership and decision-making quality.
