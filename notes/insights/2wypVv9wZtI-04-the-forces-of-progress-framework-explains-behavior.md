Behavior change is driven by a system of four forces: the push of the current situation (F1), the pull of a new solution (F2), the [[concepts/anxiety|anxiety]] of the new (F3), and the habit of the present (F4). For someone to switch, the sum of the pushing and pulling forces must be greater than the sum of the anxiety and habit forces. Reducing friction (anxiety and habit) is often more effective than just adding more product features to increase pull.
