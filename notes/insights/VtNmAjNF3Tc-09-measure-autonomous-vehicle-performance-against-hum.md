Key performance metrics for autonomous vehicles include safety, compliance, and progress. The core safety goal is to drive safer than a human, which requires establishing human driving benchmarks (e.g., collisions per 100,000 miles). Teams must also balance safety with metrics like undue slowdowns or "rescue" events to ensure the vehicle is both safe and practically useful.
