Major initiatives at Block, like Goose and Cash App, started as small experiments or hack week projects built by individuals or tiny teams. This approach of starting with a narrow, achievable scope builds organic momentum. It contrasts with "boiling the ocean" projects that start too big, and it fosters a culture of [[concepts/experimentation|experimentation]] and [[concepts/innovation|innovation]].
