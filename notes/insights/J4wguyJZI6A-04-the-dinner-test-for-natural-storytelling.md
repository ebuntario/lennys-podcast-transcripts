Apply the "Dinner Test" to your stories: they should be a slightly elevated version of what you would tell someone over dinner. Avoid performance art, unattributed dialogue, or starting with sounds, as these break natural conversation flow. The goal is to speak in a way that feels authentic and connected, removing verbal filler while maintaining a natural tone.
