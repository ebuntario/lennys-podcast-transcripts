Unlike deterministic computers, human behavior and the physical world are messy and unpredictable. Products that interact with the real world must be designed with built-in flexibility and fail-safes to handle unexpected events like cancellations, no-shows, or scheduling errors. Accounting for [[concepts/real-world-entropy]] is paramount for creating a resilient and reliable user experience.
