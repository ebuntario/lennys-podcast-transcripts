The danger of the growth mindset concept is the ego's tendency to turn it into a fixed rule ("I *must* always have a growth mindset"). This creates attachment and suffering. Instead, stay attached to the principle of growth but hold the specific mindset loosely, allowing you to respond to changing realities with [[concepts/adaptability|adaptability]].
