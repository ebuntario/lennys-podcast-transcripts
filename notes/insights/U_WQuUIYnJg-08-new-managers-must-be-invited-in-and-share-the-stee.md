Effective management is not about divide-and-conquer or simply handing off tasks. Instead, think of it as sharing a steering wheel or being in a sidecar on a motorcycle—you're attached but have a specific counsel role. Crucially, you must earn the right to manage; you can't force your way in. Wait to be "invited in" when your report needs help, then partner deeply on specific areas. This approach builds trust and respect.
