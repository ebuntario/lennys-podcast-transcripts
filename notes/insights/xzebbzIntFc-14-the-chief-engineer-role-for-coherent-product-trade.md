Inspired by Toyota's production system, the "chief engineer" role is a [[concepts/product-leadership-strategy|product leadership]] model where one person holds moral authority and makes critical trade-off decisions for an entire product line from start to finish. This role typically has no direct reports but operates through a "big room" and a small staff, ensuring coherent design and thrust by centralizing the responsibility for balancing cost, features, and quality promises.
