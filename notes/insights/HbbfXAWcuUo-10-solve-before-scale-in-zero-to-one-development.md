When building something new, resist the temptation to rush to scale before truly solving the core problem. Embrace the apparent chaos of early exploration where ideas might pivot dramatically, as prematurely fixing on one approach can trap you on a local maximum. This [[concepts/early-stage|solve-before-scale]] mindset allows for necessary exploration before commitment.
