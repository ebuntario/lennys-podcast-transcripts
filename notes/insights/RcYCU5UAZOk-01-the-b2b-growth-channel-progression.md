Most B2B companies should follow a general path for scaling their [[concepts/b2b-growth|growth channels]]. Start with founder-led sales, then hire the first salespeople, followed by low-cost targeted marketing like content and community. After that, invest in PR, then paid and brand efforts, with SEO starting around the same time as paid marketing. This progression works because channels become more expensive but also more scalable and effective as you understand your customers better.
