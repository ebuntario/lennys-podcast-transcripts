In the competitive race to launch more capable models, frontier labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) have stronger incentives to improve intelligence and functionality than to solve hard security problems like [[concepts/adversarial-robustness|adversarial robustness]]. A highly secure but less capable model has less market value than a smarter, less secure one.
