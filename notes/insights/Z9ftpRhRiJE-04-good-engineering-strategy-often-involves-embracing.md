Effective [[concepts/engineering-strategy|engineering strategy]] frequently dictates using a standard set of tools or technologies, even if it frustrates some engineers. Constraints like "we only use our existing tech stack" focus energy on solving business problems rather than debating new tools. A good strategy aligns limited capacity with the company's most important goals, even when it feels restrictive.
