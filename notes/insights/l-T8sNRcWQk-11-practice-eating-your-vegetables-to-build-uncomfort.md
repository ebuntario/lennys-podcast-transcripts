[[concepts/skill-development|Eating your vegetables]] means deliberately practicing skills you dislike or find awkward, like networking or public speaking, through repeated exposure. Set lightweight, measurable goals—like handing out ten business cards at an event—to push through initial discomfort. This separates genuine dislike from unfamiliarity and builds foundational competencies.
