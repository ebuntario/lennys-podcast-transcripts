Calendly's primary growth engine is a powerful [[concepts/viral-growth|viral loop]], where 70% of signups come from recipients of a Calendly link. Solo users invite team members, creating teams. The company then uses product-qualified lead (PQL) data to identify these teams and engage department heads for expansion. While known for individual scheduling, the fastest-growing segment is now teams and departments, representing the future growth curve.
