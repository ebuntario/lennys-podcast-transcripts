A successful [[concepts/seo-growth|SEO strategy]] maps high-intent search queries ([[concepts/jobs-to-be-done|jobs to be done]]) to a seamless end-to-end experience. The journey from search result to landing page must immediately deliver on the promise and guide the user to a "magic moment" within the product. Technical SEO is ineffective without a genuinely delightful product experience at its core.
