The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a formalized wrapper that exposes enterprise tools (like Salesforce or Snowflake) to large language models. Block's open-source agent, Goose, uses MCPs to give AI "arms and legs," allowing it to orchestrate actions across different systems. This approach, built on [[concepts/open-source|open source]] principles, means teams don't have to wait for vendors to build AI features and can automate processes almost overnight.
