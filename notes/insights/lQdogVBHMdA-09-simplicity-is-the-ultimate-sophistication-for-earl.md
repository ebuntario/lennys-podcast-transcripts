The early majority—the group that determines market leadership—is afraid of change and won't try something they perceive as complex. To win them over, prioritize [[concepts/simplicity|simplicity]] above all else. After adding features through iteration, remove any that aren't used, as they only add complexity. Watch new users to understand their barriers and simplify accordingly.
