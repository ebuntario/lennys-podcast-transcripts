A key to [[concepts/humility|humility]] and effectiveness at work is recognizing you are not the protagonist in the company's story. Your role is to understand the CEO's or leadership's vision and figure out how to operationalize it into the best possible product manifestation. This mindset reduces friction and aligns your unique skills to fill gaps within the broader strategic context, rather than fighting against it.
