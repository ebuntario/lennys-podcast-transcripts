The [[concepts/product-operating-model|product operating model]] is a set of principles—like "innovation is more important than predictability" and "teams are empowered with problems to solve"—common to top product companies. It's not a specific process or framework but a conceptual model focusing on outcomes, rapid learning, and empowered cross-functional teams.
