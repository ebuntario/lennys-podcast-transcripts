When defining principles for a project or company, avoid generic statements like "move fast" that no one can disagree with. Effective principles are those that a reasonable person might question. This forces clearer [[concepts/decision-making|decision-making]] and creates a stronger, more distinctive [[concepts/team-alignment|team alignment]] around non-obvious strategic choices.
