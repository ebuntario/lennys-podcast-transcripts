Product-market fit is not a single event but a progression through four distinct levels: nascent, developing, strong, and extreme. For B2B companies, this journey typically unfolds over four to six years, with each level requiring a different focus and set of trade-offs. Understanding which level you are in helps diagnose progress and identify the right actions to advance.
