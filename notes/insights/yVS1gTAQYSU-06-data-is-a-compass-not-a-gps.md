Treating data as a tool that gives definitive answers leads to being wrong or slow. Data is more effective as a compass—it helps disprove ridiculous ideas and indicates potential directions, but it doesn't provide the final destination. Your intuition is valuable because it's built on a lifetime of absorbed data patterns. When data suggests something counter-intuitive, first assume there's an error in the data or analysis, and rigorously investigate before abandoning your instinct.
