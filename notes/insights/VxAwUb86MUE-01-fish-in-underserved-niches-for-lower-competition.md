Apply the principle of "fish where the fish are" by seeking out [[concepts/niche-markets|niche markets]] with high demand but low competition, like specialized software for government forms, rather than crowded spaces like cafes or project management tools. This approach reduces competitive pressure and increases the potential for sustainable [[concepts/competitive-advantage|profit margins]] because fewer entrepreneurs are drawn to unglamorous but valuable problems.
