Descriptive names make statements that limit imagination (e.g., Cloud Pro), while evocative names start stories that engage customers (e.g., Azure). A great name creates space for the brand narrative to unfold over time, inviting customers into an experience rather than just telling them what you do. This storytelling potential is what gives a name long-term value and flexibility.
