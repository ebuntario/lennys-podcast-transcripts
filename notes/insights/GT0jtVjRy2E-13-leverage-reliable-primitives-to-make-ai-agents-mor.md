When building AI agents for business applications, leverage existing, reliable "primitives" or components as a domain-specific language. Instead of having an agent generate all code from scratch—which can be buggy and insecure—use proven components for data layers, interfaces, and business logic. This makes the agent's output more reliable and allows non-technical users to understand and modify the result.
