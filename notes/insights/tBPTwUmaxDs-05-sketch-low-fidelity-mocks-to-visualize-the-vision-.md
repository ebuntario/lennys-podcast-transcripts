You don't need a designer to start visualizing a vision; begin with post-it notes or simple rectangles to sketch key screens. This low-fidelity [[concepts/visual-communication|visual communication]] makes the future tangible and can provoke a designer to refine it further. The goal is to bring the narrative to life, not to create perfect artwork from the start.
