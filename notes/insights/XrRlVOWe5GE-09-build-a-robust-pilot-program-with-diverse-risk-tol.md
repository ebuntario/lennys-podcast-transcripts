For mature SaaS products, establish a formal pilot program with thousands of customers across diverse industries, company sizes, and geographies. The key is selecting champions with a higher risk tolerance who are motivated to co-create. This allows you to test new, potentially disruptive functionality at scale in real work environments before a full launch, providing confidence that the feature works for a broad audience, not just internal power users.
