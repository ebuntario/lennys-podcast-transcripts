[[concepts/operational-efficiency|Operational excellence]] is essential for attaining competitive position and is a constant requirement—a "treadmill" you cannot stop running. However, it is rarely a source of durable power because best practices can usually be mimicked, hired, or copied by competitors. True process power exists only when the operations are both materially impactful and deeply inimitable.
