For zero-to-one projects, the onus is on you to create hype and momentum. Leverage large company forums like sales kickoffs or all-hands to give demos, even if the product is early-stage. This gets the entire company to "see what you see," creates excitement, and provides valuable user signal. Pushing for visibility beyond the product's current maturity can add significant fuel to the fire.
