For early-stage startups, hire a "pie-shaped" marketer—a generalist with deep expertise in one area (like product marketing) and proficiency in another. This person should be able to set strategy and manage contractors across the core functions of content, growth, and product marketing. Avoid hiring siloed specialists from large companies who lack experience building a marketing foundation from scratch.
