[[concepts/diverse-teams|Diverse teams]] transition from a social imperative to a sustainable practice when companies recognize the concrete [[concepts/business-value|business value]] they provide. This recognition drives the creation of cultures that actively utilize diverse perspectives, which in turn improves [[concepts/retention|retention]] of diverse talent. Retention then fuels easier recruitment, creating a virtuous cycle where diversity becomes embedded in the company's operational success.
