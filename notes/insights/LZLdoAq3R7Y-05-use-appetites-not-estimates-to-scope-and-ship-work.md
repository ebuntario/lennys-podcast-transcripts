Instead of estimating how long work will take, set a fixed [[concepts/constraints|appetite]] (e.g., a maximum of six weeks) as a budget you're willing to spend. This forces the team to figure out the simplest, most effective version of a feature within that constraint. This approach, central to their [[concepts/project-management|Shape Up methodology]], prevents endless projects and keeps work moving forward decisively.
