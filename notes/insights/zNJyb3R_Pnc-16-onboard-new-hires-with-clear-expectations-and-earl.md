Accelerate a new hire's impact by giving them clear expectations and ownership of a specific campaign or project from the start. Pair this with hands-on training (e.g., screen-sharing your process) to show efficient methods. This approach, combined with psychological safety to ask questions, can reduce the typical 90-day ramp time significantly.
