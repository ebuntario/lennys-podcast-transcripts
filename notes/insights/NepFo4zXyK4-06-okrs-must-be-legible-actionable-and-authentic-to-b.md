Effective [[concepts/okrs|OKRs]] or goal-setting frameworks must meet three criteria. They must be **legible** (understood by everyone), **actionable** (inspiring specific action), and **authentic** (honestly reflecting the team's daily work). If goals feel like post-rationalized task lists or obscure metrics, they fail to drive meaningful focus or alignment within the team.
