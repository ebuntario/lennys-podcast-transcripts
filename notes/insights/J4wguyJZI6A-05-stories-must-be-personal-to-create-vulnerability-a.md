Stories about other people feel like fiction to an audience and prevent you from being vulnerable. True [[concepts/vulnerability|vulnerability]] comes from opening up your own heart and mind, which builds a powerful connection with listeners. You can incorporate others' experiences by centering the story on how those events changed *you*, making the history personally relevant.
