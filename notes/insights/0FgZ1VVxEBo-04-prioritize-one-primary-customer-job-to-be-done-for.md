Most products serve multiple [[concepts/jobs-to-be-done|customer jobs]], but you must prioritize one to lead with for clarity and effectiveness. Choose the job where customers have an urgent problem, high willingness to pay, and where your company has an unfair advantage. Focusing on one job first allows for powerful, resonant messaging before layering on support for other segments.
