While [[concepts/bundling-strategy|bundling]] can be an effective growth strategy later, it hinders initial product-led growth by complicating the buyer's decision. Atlassian found that offering a single product for a fast, self-service purchase led to higher conversion rates than requiring users to evaluate a bundle. Bundling is more effective in sales-led motions or for expansion after the initial "land."
