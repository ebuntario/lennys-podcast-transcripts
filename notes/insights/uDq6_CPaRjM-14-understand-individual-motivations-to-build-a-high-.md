The key to a high-functioning team is understanding individual motivations, not catering to the average. Directly ask team members (especially engineers) how much they want to be involved in product decisions. Some thrive on solving technical challenges with a defined goal, while others need to contribute to the vision to feel passion. Catering to these individual drivers builds a more effective and engaged team.
