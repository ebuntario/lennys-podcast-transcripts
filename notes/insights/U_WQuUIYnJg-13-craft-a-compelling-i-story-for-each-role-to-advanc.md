For every role you're in, proactively craft the story you will tell about it in the future. Write a paragraph describing the problem you solved, the skill you built, the headwind you faced, and how *you* (using "I," not "we") overcame it. If the story isn't compelling, work to change the narrative of your current role. A powerful, personal [[concepts/career-narrative|career narrative]] is essential for both promotions and meaningful career progression.
