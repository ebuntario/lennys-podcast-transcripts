When building new products, Revolut cuts functionality to the most critical features but never compromises on [[concepts/product-quality|quality, UX, or aesthetics]]. This eliminates uncertainty about whether poor traction is due to a bad idea or a poorly executed product. The goal is to launch something people will love from the start, not a scrappy version that might fail for execution reasons.
