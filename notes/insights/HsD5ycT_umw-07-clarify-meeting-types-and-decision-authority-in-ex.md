In executive reviews, explicitly state the meeting's purpose: is it an update, a decision, or a problem-solving session? Clearly communicate your level of authority on the topic, from "I have no strong opinion" to "this is a mandate." This [[concepts/meeting-management|meeting management]] clarity prevents misaligned expectations and avoids "hero meetings" where teams prepare for weeks only for discussions to go sideways.
