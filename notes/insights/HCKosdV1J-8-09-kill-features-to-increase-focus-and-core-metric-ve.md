Actively killing features can dramatically increase a product's core metric velocity. By removing secondary capabilities, you force users to focus on the primary action that drives the business. When adding new features, consider what you can replace or remove, as a more focused product often leads to cleaner experiences and stronger user engagement on the most important tasks.
