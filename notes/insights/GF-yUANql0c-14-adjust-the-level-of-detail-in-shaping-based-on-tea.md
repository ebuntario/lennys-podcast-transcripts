The amount of solution detail provided in shaping should be a dial you turn based on the build team's experience. More junior teams benefit from clearer guidance to ensure success and learning, while senior teams can thrive with more autonomy. If a team member wants more influence on fundamental decisions, involve them in the shaping sessions directly.
