A P-value of 0.05 does not mean there's a 95% chance the treatment is better. The actual [[concepts/false-positive-risk|false positive risk]] can be much higher (e.g., 26%) when the prior probability of success is low. Consider replication or Bayesian methods to better assess true effect probability.
