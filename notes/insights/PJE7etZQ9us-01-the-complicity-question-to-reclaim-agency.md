The question "How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?" is designed to evoke personal agency, not assign blame. It helps uncover where you might be diluting yourself or enabling unwanted patterns, like feeling unnerved without a jam-packed schedule. This shifts focus from external responsibility to internal [[concepts/self-awareness|self-awareness]] and choice.
