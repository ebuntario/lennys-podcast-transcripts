Starting in operations provides a deep, ground-level understanding of how a business actually works and what truly moves its metrics. This hands-on experience, which includes direct customer interaction and managing day-to-day success, creates a strong foundation for later building scalable technology. It ensures that product decisions are informed by a genuine understanding of [[concepts/customer-proximity]] and core business mechanics.
