The first hire should be a data-driven growth marketing generalist to manage platforms. The second should be a creative (graphic design/branding) to ensure ad creative matches performance goals and brand tone. The third should be a dedicated data scientist to handle complex analysis, incrementality testing, and reporting automation.
