A key pitfall is using machine learning models that predict outcomes (correlation) to make business decisions, which requires understanding causal effects. For example, predicting which customer has the highest lifetime value is different from estimating how much a promotion will *increase* their spending. [[concepts/data-science|Data scientists]] must focus on causal inference to drive valuable actions, not just accurate predictions.
