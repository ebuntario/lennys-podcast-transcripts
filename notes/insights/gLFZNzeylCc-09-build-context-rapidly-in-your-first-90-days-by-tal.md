When joining a new company as a leader, accelerate context-building by scheduling conversations not just with your direct team and peers, but across all functions and various levels, including long-tenured individual contributors. This provides a richer, multi-faceted view of the company's challenges, culture, and opportunities far more quickly than a traditional, hierarchical approach.
