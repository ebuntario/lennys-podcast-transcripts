A dual-structure organization with "fast-thinking" and "slow-thinking" groups allows for both rapid innovation and deliberate scaling. The fast-thinking group ships new AI capabilities on a near-weekly basis to create top-of-funnel excitement and learn what's possible. The slow-thinking group focuses on scalable infrastructure and turning those adoption seeds into durable, expanding deployments.
