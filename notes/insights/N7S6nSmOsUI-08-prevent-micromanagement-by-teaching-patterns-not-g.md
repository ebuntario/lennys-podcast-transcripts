When moving into a management role, a common misstep is giving precise instructions that solve only the immediate problem. Instead, focus on teaching repeatable patterns and frameworks that empower your team to solve future problems independently. A practical tactic is to write down what you want to say in a meeting on a Post-it and see if someone else articulates it first, thereby building their [[concepts/delegation|delegation]] and critical thinking skills.
