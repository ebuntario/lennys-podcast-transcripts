Start [[concepts/community-building|community building]] with the smallest viable seed of engaged people to establish initial [[concepts/momentum|momentum]] and positive [[concepts/norms|norms]]. Actively "feed" the community by prompting members to share ideas and creating FOMO through recaps of missed discussions. A community with only one person speaking is functionally dead, so the facilitator must nurture multi-party engagement.
