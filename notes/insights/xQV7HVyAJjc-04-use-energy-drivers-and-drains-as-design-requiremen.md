Reflect on past moments that gave you energy (energy drivers) and those that sucked life from you (energy drains). These patterns reveal your innate wiring and become non-negotiable design requirements for your next role. Aim to increase the ratio of [[concepts/energy-drivers-drains|energy-driving work]] to draining work, as this reduces stress and makes work feel less like a grind.
