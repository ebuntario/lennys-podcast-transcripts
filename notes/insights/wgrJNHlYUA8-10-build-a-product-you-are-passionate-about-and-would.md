Founders should build in a domain they are deeply passionate about, as this intrinsic motivation is critical for persevering through difficult periods. When the founders are also the target users, they can more intuitively judge product quality and fit. Choosing a market based solely on external opportunity, rather than passion, is a flawed starting point.
