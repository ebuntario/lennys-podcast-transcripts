Corp Dev professionals are superior negotiators. To avoid being outmaneuvered, always move [[concepts/negotiation|negotiations]] async by saying, "Once I see it in writing, I can socialize it with my advisors/co-founders." This prevents live pressure and gives you time to consult and strategize, balancing the power dynamic.
