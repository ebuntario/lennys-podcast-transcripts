A high-performing team needs a clear "what" (specific, measurable goals) and a compelling "why" (a mission that provides purpose). For growth teams, goals are often tied to metrics like activation rates or revenue, while the mission focuses on building delightful user experiences. This clarity aligns the team and provides a North Star for decision-making, ensuring everyone understands how their work contributes to broader objectives.
