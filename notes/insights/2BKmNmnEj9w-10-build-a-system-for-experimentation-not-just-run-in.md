To experiment at scale, you need a system, not just a series of tests. Start with a clear [[concepts/growth-model|growth model]] to understand how your company grows. Ensure robust [[concepts/instrumentation|instrumentation]] so experiment results are trustworthy. Setting an ambitious experiment count goal (like 1,000/year) forces conversations about enabling no-code tests, expanding beyond product teams, and building the right observability.
