The resources you dedicate to testing a new channel should reflect your company's risk tolerance and current team bandwidth. If you have a small team and only one working channel, allocate perhaps half a person's time to exploration; if you have a 20-person team and strong alignment, you might assign three dedicated people. This [[concepts/resource-allocation|resource allocation]] should be part of a structured roadmap, not random experiments, and rarely justify diverting an entire team for multiple sprints without early signals.
