When economic or market conditions shift, assume your [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]] may no longer hold, because you achieved fit in a different environment. Rather than immediately launching new channels to fix growth problems, first verify that your core value proposition still resonates with the changed customer base. This foundational reassessment prevents wasted effort on channel expansion when the underlying market alignment has shifted.
