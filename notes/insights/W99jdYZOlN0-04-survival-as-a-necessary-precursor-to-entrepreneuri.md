In technology's hype cycles, the prevailing narrative encourages going all-in, but the most important entrepreneurial skill is survival. Founders should make asymmetrically positive decisions that don't compromise the enterprise while maintaining the perseverance to continue when conditions are difficult. The mindset that "the end is never the end" helps overcome moments that feel impassable, recognizing that imperfect solutions keep the journey alive until timing and insight align.
