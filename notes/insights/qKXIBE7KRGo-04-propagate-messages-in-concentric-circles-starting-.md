To control your message and ensure it spreads effectively, start with a one-page plan identifying your key audience circles. Begin with your inner circle (yourself, co-founders, employees), then move outward to investors, power users, and key influencers. You cannot skip a circle, as each outer group looks to the inner circle for credibility and alignment.
