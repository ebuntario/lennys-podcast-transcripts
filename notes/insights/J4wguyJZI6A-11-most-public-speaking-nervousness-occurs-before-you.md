Recognize that 98% of speaking nervousness happens *before* you begin, and it largely falls away once you start. This realization can be relieving, and you're in the same boat as most speakers, including experienced professionals. Preparation reduces nerves—practice by recording your talk and listening to it passively so it becomes ingrained.
