When other teams in your organization are receiving positive attention and delivering impact, approach them with curiosity, not envy. Seek to understand what they are doing well, how they operate, and what you can learn from them. Building connections with successful teams and aligning your work with theirs is a more effective path to impact than viewing them as competitors operating under unfair advantages.
