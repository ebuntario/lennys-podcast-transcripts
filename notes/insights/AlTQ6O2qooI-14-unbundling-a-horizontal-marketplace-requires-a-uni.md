Successfully unbundling a category from a horizontal marketplace (like eBay) is rarer than often hyped. It requires a wedge that overcomes the horizontal player's advantages in customer LTV and network effects. Successful examples like StockX (sneakers) solved a critical trust and verification problem in a high-value segment, or served a large, self-contained network (e.g., blue-collar job platforms).
