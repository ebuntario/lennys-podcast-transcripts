Conway's Law states that organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure. The inverse is also true: you can often look at a product and deduce the [[concepts/organizational-design|org design]] that created it. Most execution problems (70-80%) are **setup issues** stemming from misaligned OKRs, poor team topology, or unclear ownership, not individual capability or motivation failures.
