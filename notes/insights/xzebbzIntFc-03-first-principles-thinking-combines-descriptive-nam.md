Effective [[concepts/first-principles-thinking|first principles thinking]] has two key components. First, it involves descriptive work—giving a name and concept to a phenomenon that already exists, which allows people to reason about it. Second, the prescriptive parts flow from deductive logic based on those foundational principles, enabling teams to derive actionable practices from core hypotheses.
