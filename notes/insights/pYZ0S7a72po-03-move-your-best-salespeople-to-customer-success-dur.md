When acquiring new customers is difficult, your highest leverage action is to retain existing ones. Reassign your top account executives to customer success manager (CSM) roles to patch "leaky bucket" churn. This ensures your best relationship builders are focused on keeping current customers happy, as replacing them will be far harder than acquiring new ones in a tight market.
