A core philosophy should be prioritizing [[concepts/value-proposition|value creation]] over value capture. If customers say your tool is 20-35% as valuable as their core infrastructure, charge only a small fraction of that perceived value. This builds immense trust and goodwill, pays back slowly over the long term, and aligns the company with serving users rather than extracting maximum revenue.
