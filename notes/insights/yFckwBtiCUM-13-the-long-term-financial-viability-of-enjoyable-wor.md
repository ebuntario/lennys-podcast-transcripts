While initial income might drop when pursuing work you love, sustainable, long-term financial viability is often easier to achieve because you're willing to persist. You can structure your life with lower initial earnings focused on exploration, then gradually build income streams from the work you genuinely enjoy. This creates a more resilient and satisfying financial foundation than a high-paying but draining career.
