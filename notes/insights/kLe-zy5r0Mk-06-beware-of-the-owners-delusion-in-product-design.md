The [[concepts/owners-delusion|owner's delusion]] is the failure to recognize that users are not as invested in your product as you are. They are distracted humans with low intent, not an attentive audience. To combat this, consciously pause, pretend you are a regular person encountering your product for the first time, and see if the purpose and next steps are immediately clear.
