You know more about your company's reality than external critics, analysts, or media. While you should listen to external perspectives for blind spots, beware of [[concepts/gell-mann-amnesia|Gell-Mann Amnesia]]—believing critiques on topics you know nothing about while dismissing flawed coverage on topics you understand. Use your expertise to triangulate the truth, not blindly accept external narratives.
