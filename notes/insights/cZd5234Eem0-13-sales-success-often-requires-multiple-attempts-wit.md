A 20-30% win rate is solid, meaning most prospects won't buy on the first attempt. However, a prospect who isn't ready now may be ready in the future. Persistence in re-engaging qualified accounts over time can lead to significant deals, as the win rate on the second or third time through the pipeline can be much higher.
