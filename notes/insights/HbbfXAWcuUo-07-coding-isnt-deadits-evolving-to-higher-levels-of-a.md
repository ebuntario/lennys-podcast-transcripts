The assertion that "coding is dead" misunderstands the evolution of [[concepts/software-development|software development]]. We've always moved to higher layers of abstraction, from assembly to C to modern languages; AI represents the next step in this progression. Understanding computer science fundamentals remains crucial as we'll have more "software operators" telling computers what to do at much higher conceptual levels.
