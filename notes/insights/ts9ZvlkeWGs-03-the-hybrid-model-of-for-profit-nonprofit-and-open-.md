A powerful model for sustainable open source involves a for-profit entity, a nonprofit foundation, and the open-source community working in concert with checks and balances. The for-profit can fund development and provide accessible services, the nonprofit can handle education and community stewardship, and the open-source project remains freely available. This tripartite structure, inspired by branches of government, helps balance commercial needs with [[concepts/stewardship|community ideals]].
