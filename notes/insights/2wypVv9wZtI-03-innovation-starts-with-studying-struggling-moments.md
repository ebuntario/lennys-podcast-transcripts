True innovation begins by identifying and deeply understanding the [[concepts/struggling-moment|struggling moments]] that cause demand, which exist long before any product is built. A product roadmap should be organized around these struggling moments rather than a fixed list of features, as this allows flexibility to solve the problem with new technologies as they emerge. This approach is more resilient than trying to predict and build specific features years in advance.
