Instead of goaling directly on long-term outcomes like retention (which are hard to move quickly), identify short-term proxy metrics that are inputs to those outcomes. Test through [[concepts/testing|experimentation]] whether moving the proxy actually drives the desired long-term result, enabling faster iteration and learning.
