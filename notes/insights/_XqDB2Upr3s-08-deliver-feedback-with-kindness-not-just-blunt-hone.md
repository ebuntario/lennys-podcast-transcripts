Honesty is valuable, but delivering feedback must be paired with [[concepts/emotional-intelligence|kindness and empathy]] to be productive. The goal is to help the person improve, not just to state a truth. Frame feedback in a way that shows care and belief in their ability to fix the issue, which is more effective than blunt criticism that can demoralize.
