When measuring growth investment ROI, prioritize payback period over CAC or LTV:CAC. CAC focuses only on cost and can lead to acquiring less valuable customers, while LTV:CAC relies on long-term, assumption-heavy projections. [[concepts/payback-period|Payback period]]—using contribution margin—is based on more recent data and shows how many months of profit it takes to recover the acquisition cost, providing a more grounded efficiency metric.
