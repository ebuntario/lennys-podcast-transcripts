Building networks of PhDs and professionals for AI training work relies heavily on referral systems where satisfied contributors recommend peers. Experts participate not just for financial compensation but for the opportunity to contribute their specialized knowledge to advancing AI, especially when they encounter models that don't understand their domain. Campus programs that engage professors and students, combined with a rewarding contributor experience, create organic growth mechanisms that outperform traditional recruitment channels.
