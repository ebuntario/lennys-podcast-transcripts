The .com domain has become like an area code—its importance has diminished significantly with the rise of AI and changing search behaviors. Focus first on finding the right name, then work around domain availability with prefixes, suffixes, or alternative extensions (.ai, .io). If necessary, a desirable .com can often be purchased for a reasonable sum, but don't let domain availability dictate your naming decision.
