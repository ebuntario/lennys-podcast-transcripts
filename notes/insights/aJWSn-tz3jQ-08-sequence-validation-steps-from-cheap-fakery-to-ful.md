You don't need to build a full MVP to start learning. A validation ladder starts with cheap assessments (alignment checks, ICE scoring), moves to fact-finding (data analysis, surveys), then to faked tests (Wizard of Oz, fake doors), and finally to building rough versions (alphas, dogfooding). This [[concepts/testing|sequential testing approach]] allows you to poke many ideas quickly and invest more only in those that show promising evidence.
