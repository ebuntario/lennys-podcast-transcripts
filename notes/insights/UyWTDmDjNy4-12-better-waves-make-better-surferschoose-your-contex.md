Great surfers are often on good waves; they wait for the right wave to perform their best. Similarly, in business and careers, a significant part of success comes from choosing the right context or opportunity. Be willing to wait for the right [[concepts/context|wave]] (project, hire, company) rather than rushing to meet an artificial deadline with mediocre results.
