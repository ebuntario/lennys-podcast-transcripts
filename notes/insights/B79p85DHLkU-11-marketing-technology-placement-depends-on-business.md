Marketing technology functions can reside in growth, product operations, IT, or revenue operations depending on company context. B2C companies typically benefit from centralized marketing technology within growth teams, while B2B organizations often place it in revenue operations. The key consideration is aligning the function with its primary stakeholders while ensuring sufficient technical expertise and cross-functional influence.
