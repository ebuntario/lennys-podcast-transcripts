The opposite of distraction is traction—any action taken with intent that pulls you toward your goals. If an activity isn't on your schedule, it's a distraction, even if it's work-related like checking email. Defining [[concepts/traction|traction]] versus distraction based on intent removes moral judgment and clarifies what deserves your attention at any given moment.
