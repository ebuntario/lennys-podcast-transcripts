Regularly give specific, positive feedback with the same care as constructive feedback. For example, "The way you organized that launch led to these specific benefits" is more impactful than "good job." This practice boosts morale, helps people see their progress, and builds a [[concepts/psychological-safety|reservoir of goodwill]]. This foundation of trust makes it easier for employees to receive and act on difficult feedback when it is necessary.
