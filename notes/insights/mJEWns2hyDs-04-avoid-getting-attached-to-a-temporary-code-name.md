A common naming mistake is becoming attached to an early code name used for incorporation or internal development. To prevent this, choose a temporary code name that is so ridiculous you would never launch with it. This forces you to go through a proper naming process later and select a name that actively supports your [[concepts/brand-building|brand-building]] efforts.
