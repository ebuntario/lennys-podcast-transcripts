Many early-stage companies mistake brand awareness for [[concepts/branding|branding power]]. You can buy recognition (like a Super Bowl ad), but true branding power is a durable economic advantage where the brand itself allows for premium pricing or lower costs. This type of power is usually only available to businesses in a much later, stable phase.
