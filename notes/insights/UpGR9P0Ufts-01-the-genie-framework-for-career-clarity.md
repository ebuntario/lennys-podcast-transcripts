The "genie framework" asks: if a genie guaranteed success and happiness in any path you fully commit to, what would you choose? This question bypasses [[concepts/fear-of-failure|fear of failure]] and societal pressure to reveal your true passion. The answer points toward the career or life path you should pursue, even if you can't start immediately.
