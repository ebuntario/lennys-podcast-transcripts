You don't get to decide *if* you'll have a [[concepts/value-based-pricing|pricing]] and willingness-to-pay conversation, only *when*. It's far better to have this discussion before building the product rather than when your sales team is trying to sell something users aren't excited to pay for. Learn price elasticity early while the stakes are lower, as pricing evolves and becomes more complex over time.
