When expanding a marketplace, prioritize opportunities based on adjacency (how similar the new vertical is to your core model) and potential to accentuate [[concepts/network-effects|network effects]]. For example, Uber expanding into Eats leverages the same driver supply and serves overlapping customer demand. Total market size (TAM) is less important than these factors for early expansion bets.
