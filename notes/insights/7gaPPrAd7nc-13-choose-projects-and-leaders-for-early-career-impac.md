Early in your career, optimize for working on “offense” projects that drive business growth (like revenue or customer acquisition) and for leaders who excel at prioritization and communication. Being on a high-impact project and learning from a skilled manager accelerates your development and visibility, even if you’re not setting the strategy yourself.
