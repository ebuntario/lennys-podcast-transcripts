Founders' reluctance to implement [[concepts/price-increases|price increases]] is frequently an internal, emotional hurdle rather than a logical, market-based one. As Warren Buffett noted, a great business can raise prices without a "prayer session." Frame increases as a value exchange and execute them strategically to pass on costs without significant churn.
