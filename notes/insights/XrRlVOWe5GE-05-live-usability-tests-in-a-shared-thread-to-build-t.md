Instead of just reading summarized research reports, have PMs, designers, and engineers join a live Slack thread during remote usability tests. As they watch a real user struggle, they react in real-time with observations, pain points, and ideas. This thread becomes the source of truth for the research and, more importantly, builds shared humility and a visceral understanding of user needs across the entire [[concepts/product-team|product team]].
