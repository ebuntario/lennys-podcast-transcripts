A startup journey has distinct phases: first, focus entirely on finding [[concepts/product-market-fit|product-market fit]]; then, shift to either figuring out the business model or scaling growth. Trying to do multiple things at once leads to failure. Focus is about what you choose not to do, and each phase requires the company to "shift gears" completely in its priorities and resource allocation.
