Adopt a "ship, quit, and learn" mindset for exploring new ventures. Commit to shipping a small, time-bound project (like five podcast episodes) with the explicit intent to quit afterward and evaluate how it felt. This approach removes the pressure for long-term success and turns the project into a pure learning experiment about your own energy and interest.
